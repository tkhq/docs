title: "Turnkey Verified"
---

Turnkey Verified is a new feature launched in Turnkey's [dashboard](https://app.turnkey.com) and [Embedded Wallet Kit](/reference/embedded-wallet-kit).

As outlined in our [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.turnkey.com/foundations#boot-proofs-and-app-proofs), Turnkey deploys software in secure enclaves and can remotely attest to the software running inside of them. We've done this since day one, internally: remote attestations are at the core of our deployment process and are a crucial tool to ensure Turnkey operators are provisioning enclaves with the correct configuration.

For the first time we're exposing proofs produced by our TEEs to the outside world. Turnkey's infrastructure produces two types of proofs: **Boot Proofs** and **App Proofs**.

### Boot Proofs

A Boot Proof is a proof that a particular AWS Nitro Enclave has booted with a particular configuration. A Boot Proof contains:
* An AWS attestation document, which contains AWS-level information: [PCR measurements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html#where), certificate chain, public key, and user data.
* A signed [QOS manifest](https://github.com/tkhq/qos/blob/f773bb8fbe0b84c93c585f1ab10882fb570d8005/src/qos_core/src/protocol/services/boot.rs#L310-L327) which contains information about the application running in this particular enclave: binary hash and arguments, operator public keys, quorum public key, and more.

### App Proofs

An App Proof is a signature produced by an enclave Ephemeral Key to prove application-specific facts about functionality.

What is an Ephemeral Key? Upon boot, enclaves create a unique **Ephemeral Key** which never leaves the enclave. As a result, data signed by an Ephemeral Key proves that it was signed by a particular machine.

We envision enclave applications will need to prove many different types of facts about processed inputs, or about their outputs, or both. For this reason we're standardizing App Proof content (the "message" that is signed by Ephemeral Keys) to be strictly typed: each App Proof must have a well-defined type ("proof type"), and a well-defined schema for any data associated with that proof.

To summarize: App Proofs contain JSON payloads, serialized and signed by enclave Ephemeral Keys.


### Claims and verification

Boot Proofs are application-agnostic. They prove 3 claims:
* **A particular machine is a legitimate AWS Nitro Enclave**. This can be verified by checking the signature of the attestation and the associated certificate bundle: it contains a chain of certificates going up to the root certificate for the commercial AWS partitions (can be downloaded from https://aws-nitro-enclaves.amazonaws.com/AWS_NitroEnclaves_Root-G1.zip).
* **A particular machine is running within Turnkey's AWS account**. This can be verified by looking at the `PCR3` measurement inside of the AWS attestation document. It should be `b798abfdbd591d5e1b7db6485a6de9e65100f5796d9e3a2bd7c179989cd663338b567162974974fbcc45d03847e70d8b` (this is the sha384 digest of the parent instance role: `arn:aws:iam::705331783682:role/talos-worker`. The role is `talos-worker` because Turnkey uses a [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/)-based Kubernetes cluster to deploy all software, including enclave software).
* **A particular machine runs the correct, expected software**. This can be verified in a few steps:
  * Verify that `PCR0`, `PCR1`, and `PCR2` values are correct and match a known QOS version. You can [reproduce these hashes yourself](https://github.com/tkhq/qos?tab=readme-ov-file#reproducing-builds) or look at our [`tkhq/core-enclaves`](https://github.com/tkhq/core-enclaves) repository for known good values.
  * Verify that the AWS attestation document's `user_data` is the digest of the QOS manifest, to ensure you are looking at the correct QOS manifest.
  * Parse the QOS manifest and inspect it to find the digest of the application.
  * Verify this digest against known good digests published in our [`tkhq/core-enclaves`](https://github.com/tkhq/core-enclaves) repository.

App Proofs and Boot Proofs are linked together by the `public_key` field of the AWS attestation document. So, in addition to proving the key claims outlined above, a Boot Proof proves the validity of all App Proofs signed by the Ephemeral Key it references.
In other words, a Boot Proof attests to the fact that the public key referenced in its `public_key` field is indeed the Ephemeral Key of a particular enclave, provisioned with a very specific configuration, operating system, and application.

Verifying an App Proof thus involves 3 simple steps:
* Verify that the App Proof public key matches the `public_key` field of a **valid** Boot Proof.
* Verify the App Proof signature validity (standard P-256 signature verification)
* Parse the content of the App Proof payload (JSON) and use the data within it to verify claimed facts (see below for an example).

# Use cases

Turnkey Verified currently supports two App Proof types, each verifying a different operation performed inside a secure enclave.

### Address Derivation Proofs

Address derivation proofs verify that a crypto address was correctly derived by Turnkey's **signer application**. These proofs are generated when new wallets are created. Turnkey verified will automatically fetch and verify proofs for you when new wallets are created through Turnkey's [Embedded Wallet Kit](/reference/embedded-wallet-kit) or via Turnkey's [dashboard](https://app.turnkey.com).

The payload:
```json
{
  "type": "APP_PROOF_TYPE_ADDRESS_DERIVATION",
  "timestampMs": "1758909116",
  "addressDerivationProof": {
    "organizationId": "your-organization-id",
    "walletId": "your-wallet-id",
    "derivationPath": "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0",
    "address": "0x61f4Ec0630DD50F1393cbDB60e5ccA1ed98f5100"
  }
}
```

### Policy Outcome Proofs

Policy outcome proofs verify that policy decisions for your activity requests were properly evaluated against your org's policies by Turnkey's **policy engine application** in a secure enclave. These proofs can be generated for all activities.

The payload:
```json
{
  "type": "APP_PROOF_TYPE_POLICY_OUTCOME",
  "timestampMs": "1758909116",
  "policyOutcomeProof": {
    "organizationId": "your-organization-id",
    "outcome": "OUTCOME_ALLOW",
    "decisionContextDigest": "your-decision-context-digest",
    "organizationDataDigest": "your-organization-data-digest",
    "parentOrganizationDataDigest": "your-parent-organization-data-digest",
    "userRequestApprovals": "your-request-signatures"
  }
}
```

### App Proof Structure

All App Proofs share a common structure. Enclave applications sign the above JSON payloads to produce App Proofs. Address derivation proof example:

```json
{
  "scheme": "SIGNATURE_SCHEME_EPHEMERAL_KEY_P256",
  // Fake Ephemeral Public Key used for demonstration purposes
  "publicKey": "04dc8333ff552b2ffa91d410c10ad0ae36055a9232f176e07f115db460aafbb959057834d367d1724b699b56bd2fd5ca30d3ee755f93c68c24a67e8e60bf37c7dd045417fb43faadacd8471cfbbf3733f4b4ea5602b9d84d3731d581fe7a69b7de42a025e5f63b8580bdb38c76b8ac3c2ae17ed047993c19835eca0491753de52f01",
  // Serialized payload matching the example from above
  "proofPayload":"{\"type\":\"APP_PROOF_TYPE_ADDRESS_DERIVATION\",\"timestampMs\":\"1758909116\",\"addressDerivationProof\":{\"organizationId\":\"your-organization-id\",\"walletId\":\"your-wallet-id\",\"derivationPath\":\"m/44'/60'/0'/0/0\",\"address\":\"0x61f4Ec0630DD50F1393cbDB60e5ccA1ed98f5100\"}}",
  // P-256 signature by the Ephemeral Key over the proofPayload (JSON) bytes
  "signature":"ecdff31d3543cd65cc9c9f8e4e758be226243b212d44426a8f9e8fefe7ba2a95410a661818560b43e92404a2ec6e6dcbe2bb79e329be0b4df441ba715d6fce44"
}
```

#### Verification Guarantees

By combining App Proof and Boot Proof verification, Turnkey Verified guarantees that the operation was performed:
* in the context of your Turnkey organization
* within a secure Turnkey enclave application
* inside of a legitimate and precise version of [QuorumOS](https://github.com/tkhq/qos)
* inside of a legitimate [AWS Nitro Enclave](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html)
* inside Turnkey's canonical AWS production account

### Open-source tooling

We have written open-source code in our [Rust SDK](https://github.com/tkhq/rust-sdk/tree/main/proofs) and [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/crypto/src/proof.ts) to verify App Proofs and Boot Proofs. This logic powers the "Verified" UI component you'll see when new addresses are derived via our Embedded Wallet Kit or dashboard.

Feel free to inspect this code and run it locally on your own hardware, and reach out if you run into bugs or if you have further questions!
