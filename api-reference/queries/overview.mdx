# What are queries?

Queries are read-only operations that let you fetch information from Turnkey's API without modifying any resources. Query endpoints are always prefixed with `/public/v1/query`.

- **No Policy Enforcement:** Queries are not subject to the policy engine, so any authenticated user in your organization can perform them.
- **Organization-wide Access:** All users within an organization can read any data within the organization. Parent organizations can also query data for all of their sub-organizations.
- **Use Cases:** Common use cases include listing users, retrieving organization details, and fetching activity logs.
