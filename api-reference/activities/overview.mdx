# What Are Activities?

Activities (also called submissions) are requests to create, modify, or use resources within Turnkey. Submission endpoints are always prefixed with `/public/v1/submit`.

- **Policy Enforcement:** Activities are subject to consensus or condition enforcement via the policy engine.
- **Optimistic Execution:** Activities are executed optimistically synchronous—if possible, the request completes synchronously; otherwise, it falls back to asynchronous processing.
- **Activity Status:**
  - `COMPLETED`: The activity was successful and the `result` field is populated.
  - `FAILED`: The activity failed and the `failure` field contains the reason.
  - `CONSENSUS_NEEDED`: More signatures are required to process the request.
  - `PENDING`: The request is processing asynchronously.
- **Status Updates:** You can get updates by re-submitting the request (idempotent) or polling `get_activity` with the activity ID.
- **Idempotency:** The API is idempotent—identical requests (same POST body) return the same activity. To generate a new activity, change the `timestampMs` value in your request.

For a full list of available activities and their parameters, see the [Activities API Reference](/api-reference/activities).
