title: "Wallets"
description: "Wallets contain collections of deterministically generated cryptographic public / private key pairs that share a common seed. Turnkey securely holds the common seed, but only you can access it. In most cases, Wallets should be preferred over Private Keys since they can be represented by a mnemonic phrase, used across a variety of cryptographic curves, and can derive many addresses."

Derived addresses can be used to create digital signatures using the corresponding underlying private key. See [Signing](/api-reference/signing/overview) for more information
