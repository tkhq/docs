description: "Signers allow you to create digital signatures. Signatures are used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message. Turnkey makes it easy to produce signatures by allowing you to sign with an address. If Turnkey doesn't yet support an address format you need, you can generate and sign with the public key instead by using the address format `ADDRESS_FORMAT_COMPRESSED`."
