## Send crypto to a non-signed in user via a URL
A simple way to utilize pre-generated wallets to enable existing users of your app to send new users crypto via a simple link. When the new user clicks on the link, they will be able to access an in-app wallet that has already been topped up with crypto from the original user. You can view an example of the feature below:

Here 's how to get started:

<steps>
    <step> Pre-requisites: Ensure that your organization is set up in a way so that end users of your application are mapped to sub-organizations (1 end user = 1 sub-org). Your original end user (“Sender”) should be represented by an individual, permanent sub-org. They will use their wallet in this sub-org to send funds. You should also have email authentication set up for your application. 
    </step>
    <step> Create a new temporary sub-org and a wallet for that sub-org. The sub-org should include both the original end user and the receiving user (“Receiver”). The sub-org should also have the Sender’s email or phone number associated with it, and a corresponding API key. 
    </step>
    <step> Create a policy to ensure that the Sender can only access the wallet in this sub-org, so that they can reclaim existing funds if they have not been claimed by the Receiver. 
    </step>
    <step> The Sender can now send funds to the wallet in the temporary sub-org. </step>
    <step> When a link is generated for the Receiver to claim their wallet, it will contain the pri vate key component of the API key that was generated by the Sender. This will exist as part of the query params of the link, and is never exposed to your app’s servers or Turnkey. You can also configure the link to correspond to an individual transaction ID within your app.
    </step>
    <step> When the Receiver wants to claim the wallet, they can click the link and sign up for your app. A permanent sub-org will then be created for the Receiver, and prompt them to complete the Email Auth flow to authenticate or add a new authenticator. </step>
    <step> The temporary sub-org is now controlled by both the Sender and the Receiver. A new session will be created so that the Receiver will use the private key passed in the link to send funds to their newly created permanent sub-org. </step>
    <step> After the funds are received, the temporary sub-org can be deleted. </step>
