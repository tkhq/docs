title: "Import wallets and keys"
description: "Turnkey's import functionality allows your end users to securely transfer a [Wallet](/concepts/wallets) or a [Private Key](/concepts/wallets#private-keys) onto the Turnkey platform via CLI or an embedded iframe. We engineered this feature to ensure that the user can import their mnemonic or private key into a Turnkey secure enclave without exposing it to Turnkey or your application."

The process of importing wallets or private keys into Turnkey is broken up into three primary steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Initialize the import process. This produces an import bundle, containing a
    public key and signature. These artifacts will be used in the next step to
    ensure that key material is only accessible by Turnkey, and cannot be
    extracted by any man-in-the-middle (MITM)
  </Step>
  <Step>Encrypt the key material to the artifacts from the previous step</Step>
  <Step>Import the encrypted bundle to Turnkey</Step>
</Steps>
