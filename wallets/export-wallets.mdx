title: "Export Wallets and Keys"
description: "Turnkey's export functionality allows your end users to backup or transfer a [Wallet](/concepts/wallets) by securely viewing the wallet's [mnemonic phrase](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mnemonic), a [Wallet Account](https://docs.turnkey.com/concepts/wallets#accounts) or a raw [Private Key](https://docs.turnkey.com/concepts/wallets#private-keys). We engineered this feature to ensure that the user can export their mnemonic or private key without exposing it to Turnkey or your application."

The process of exporting wallets, wallet accounts or private keys from Turnkey is broken up into two primary steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Export the wallet, wallet account or private key via Turnkey. You must specify the wallet ID, wallet address or
    private key ID, as well as a target public key, which the wallet or private
    key will be encrypted to. Encryption ensures that the key material is only
    accessible by the client, and cannot be extracted by any man-in-the-middle
    (MITM)
  </Step>
  <Step>Decrypt the resulting bundle returned by Turnkey. This will result in the wallet mnemonic or the private key in case of exporting a wallet account or raw private key.</Step>
</Steps>
