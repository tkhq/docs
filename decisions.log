# Redirect Validation Utility - Decision Log
This file tracks all decisions made during the implementation process along with rationales.

## Decision Table

| ID | Step | Decision | Options Considered | Selected Option | Rationale |
|----|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| D001 | Step 1: Planning | Programming Language | JavaScript, TypeScript | TypeScript | - Provides type safety and better code organization for complex data structures like redirect chains<br>- The existing project already uses TypeScript (as seen in scripts/gen.ts) |
| D002 | Step 1: Planning | Execution Environment | Node.js + tsc, Node.js + ts-node | Node.js with ts-node | - Enables direct execution of TypeScript without a separate compilation step<br>- Consistent with the current project setup (seen in the Makefile) |
| D003 | Step 1: Planning | HTTP Client | Axios, built-in fetch, undici | undici | - Originally planned to use built-in fetch, but needed better cross-version Node.js compatibility<br>- Undici provides a modern fetch API implementation that works across Node.js versions<br>- Used by Node.js itself for its native fetch implementation |
| D004 | Step 1: Planning | File Structure | Monolithic, Modular | Modular | - Improves maintainability and allows for easier testing of individual components<br>- Separation of concerns for different aspects of the validation process |
| D005 | Step 1: Planning | Orchestration | npm scripts, Makefile | Makefile | - The project already uses a Makefile for task running<br>- Provides a simple interface for developers to run the validation utility |
| D006 | Step 2: Parsing | Path Parameter Handling | Regex-based, Path library | Regex-based | - More flexible for handling complex path patterns with parameters<br>- Direct control over pattern matching and parameter extraction |
| D007 | Step 2: Parsing | Error Handling | Exit on error, Continue with warnings | Detailed error reporting with exit | - Ensures that users are aware of critical issues immediately<br>- Prevents continuing with invalid data that could lead to misleading results |
| D008 | Step 2: Parsing | Redirect Summary | Basic count, Detailed analysis | Detailed categorization | - Provides more insights into the redirect structure (permanent vs temporary, path parameters)<br>- Helps identify potential complexity in validation early |
| D009 | Project Structure | Directory Organization | Flat structure, Nested structure | Nested structure (scripts/redirect-validator) | - Improves organization by grouping related files together<br>- Allows for better isolation and potential reuse of the utility<br>- Follows a more modular approach consistent with decision D004 |
| D010 | Step 3: Chain Building | Chain Length Limit | No limit, Configurable limit | Fixed limit (10) | - Prevents infinite loops in circular redirects<br>- Keeps chain analysis performant for large redirect sets<br>- 10 steps is a reasonable maximum for well-designed redirects |
| D011 | Step 3: Validation | HTTP Client Config | Check all destinations, Optional checking | Optional checking with defaults | - Makes validation flexible for different environments<br>- Allows skipping network requests for faster validation during development<br>- Default to not checking destinations to avoid network errors during basic validation |
| D012 | Step 3: Validation | Validation Status Types | Binary (pass/fail), Graduated status | Three-level status (valid/warning/invalid) | - Provides more nuanced reporting<br>- Allows distinguishing between critical issues (invalid) and potential concerns (warnings)<br>- Makes reports more actionable by highlighting the most important issues |
| D013 | Step 3: Reporting | Report Format | JSON, Plain text, Markdown | Markdown | - Human-readable format for easy consumption<br>- Can be viewed directly in GitHub or other Markdown viewers<br>- Supports rich formatting for better organization of results |
| D014 | Step 3: Reporting | Exit Strategy | Always exit with 0, Exit with error code | Exit with error if invalid redirects | - Enables CI/CD integration by failing the build when redirects are invalid<br>- Helps enforce quality standards in the deployment process<br>- Makes issues more visible by blocking processes that depend on valid redirects |
| D015 | Step 3: Dependencies | Package Management | Global dependencies, Scoped dependencies | Scoped dependencies | - Creates a dedicated package.json in the redirect-validator directory<br>- Isolates dependencies to just the utility without affecting the main project<br>- Provides better portability and reproducibility |
| D016 | Step 3: Cleanup | Directory Structure | Keep wrapper script, Direct implementation | Direct implementation | - Removes unnecessary indirection and simplifies the codebase<br>- Avoids maintenance overhead of keeping multiple entry points in sync<br>- Makes the project structure more intuitive with a single, clear entry point |
| D017 | Step 3: Configuration | Configuration Method | Hard-coded, Environment variables, Command-line args | Make variables + Command-line args | - Provides flexibility to change configuration without modifying code<br>- Allows easy overriding of defaults when running the utility<br>- Integrates well with the existing Makefile approach for orchestration |
