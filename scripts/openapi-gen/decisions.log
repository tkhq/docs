# OpenAPI Generator - Decision Log

This file tracks all decisions made during the implementation process along with rationales.

## Decision Table

| ID | Step | Decision | Options Considered | Selected Option | Rationale |
|----|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| D001 | Phase 1 | Programming Language | JavaScript, TypeScript | TypeScript | - Provides type safety and better code organization<br>- Consistent with other utilities in the project |
| D002 | Phase 1 | Execution Environment | Node.js + tsc, Node.js + ts-node | Node.js with ts-node | - Enables direct execution of TypeScript without compilation<br>- Simpler development workflow |
| D003 | Phase 1 | OpenAPI Parser | Swagger Parser, OpenAPI Parser | @readme/openapi-parser | - More robust handling of references<br>- Better error messages for invalid specifications |
| D004 | Phase 1 | CLI Argument Parsing | Minimist, Yargs, Commander | Commander | - More structured API for defining commands<br>- Built-in help generation<br>- Good TypeScript support |
| D005 | Phase 1 | Project Structure | Monolithic File, Modular Structure | Modular Structure | - Better separation of concerns<br>- Easier to maintain and extend<br>- Improved testability |
| D006 | Phase 2 | Code Structure | Monolithic, Modular | Modular with Utilities | - Enhanced maintainability by separating concerns<br>- Makes future extensions easier<br>- Follows software engineering best practices |
| D007 | Phase 2 | JSON Path Implementation | Simple Dot Notation, Enhanced Path Support | Enhanced Path Support | - More flexible for complex queries<br>- Support for both dot notation and bracket notation<br>- Better handling of arrays and nested objects |
| D008 | Phase 2 | Error Handling | Generic Errors, Typed Errors | Typed Errors with Exit Codes | - More informative for users<br>- Helps in automated environments by providing specific exit codes<br>- Makes debugging easier |
| D009 | Phase 2 | Output Formats | JSON Only, Multiple Formats | JSON and YAML | - YAML is more human-readable<br>- OpenAPI specs often use YAML format<br>- Gives users more flexibility |
