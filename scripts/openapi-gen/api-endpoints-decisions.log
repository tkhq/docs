# OpenAPI to API Endpoints - Decision Log

This file tracks all decisions made during the API Endpoint generator implementation along with rationales.

## Decision Table

| ID | Phase | Decision | Options Considered | Selected Option | Rationale |
|----|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| ED001 | Phase 1 | Module Structure | Integrated, Separate Module | Separate Module | - Keeps the codebase organized and maintainable<br>- Maintains separation of concerns<br>- Makes it easier to extend in the future |
| ED002 | Phase 1 | Version Handling | Combined, Separate Objects | Separate Objects | - Provides clearer documentation<br>- Makes each version's API easier to understand<br>- Simplifies client code that consumes specific versions |
| ED003 | Phase 1 | Implementation Scope | Full Implementation, Required Properties Only | Required Properties Only | - Allows for incremental implementation<br>- Faster delivery of minimal viable functionality<br>- Easier to test and validate the core approach |
| ED004 | Phase 2 | String Transformations | Inline, Utility Functions | Utility Functions | - Encapsulates transformation logic in reusable functions<br>- Improves readability and maintainability<br>- Makes it easier to handle edge cases consistently |
| ED005 | Phase 2 | Component Matching | Single Loop, Multi-step Approach | Multi-step Approach | - Simplifies the logic by breaking down into smaller tasks<br>- Easier to debug and understand<br>- More flexible for future modifications |
| ED006 | Phase 2 | Output Formats | JSON Only, Multiple Formats | JSON and TypeScript | - JSON is useful for testing and interoperability<br>- TypeScript allows direct import into code<br>- Provides flexibility for different use cases |
| ED007 | Phase 2 | CLI Integration | Separate Command, CLI Option | CLI Option | - Reuses existing CLI infrastructure<br>- Allows for future extension<br>- Maintains consistent user experience |
| ED008 | Phase 3 | Schema Processing | Inline, Separate Functions | Separate Functions | - Better separation of concerns<br>- Easier to test and debug<br>- Makes the code more readable and maintainable |
| ED009 | Phase 3 | Enum Handling | String Enum Type, Dedicated Enum Type | Dedicated Enum Type | - Provides more structured representation<br>- Allows for more detailed metadata<br>- More flexibility in documentation generation |
| ED010 | Phase 3 | Nested Objects | Reference Approach, Recursive Processing | Recursive Processing | - Creates a complete hierarchical representation<br>- Simplifies consumption by client code<br>- Avoids the need for multiple passes |
