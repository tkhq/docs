You can see all of Turnkey's JavaScript packages on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:Turnkey).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to build a React Native app with Turnkey is to use our [React Native demo wallet](https://github.com/tkhq/react-native-demo-wallet) as a starter. This app is a fully-featured example that demonstrates how to use the Turnkey's JavaScript packages to authenticate users, create wallets, export wallets, sign messages, and more.

The app includes a backend [JavaScript server](https://github.com/tkhq/react-native-demo-wallet/blob/main/app/turnkey%2Bapi.ts) which uses [@turnkey/sdk-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-server) to make requests to Turnkey that must be signed by the parent organization. An example of a request that must be signed by the parent organization is creating a [sub-organization](/concepts/sub-organizations). [(code reference)](https://github.com/tkhq/react-native-demo-wallet/blob/6200e34563ed5076a1f7305c9aaa8f65d9242b53/app/turnkey%2Bapi.ts#L132-L192)

Some requests made to Turnkey must be signed by the sub-organization. These are ran by the app directly. You can find these requests in the app's [TurnkeyProvider](https://github.com/tkhq/react-native-demo-wallet/blob/main/providers/turnkey.tsx). An example of a request that must be signed by the sub-organization is creating a wallet. [(code reference)](https://github.com/tkhq/react-native-demo-wallet/blob/6200e34563ed5076a1f7305c9aaa8f65d9242b53/providers/turnkey.tsx#L609-L642)
