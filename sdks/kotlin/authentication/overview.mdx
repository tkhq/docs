The Kotlin SDK makes authentication simple.
You can call specific login and signup functions to create your own UI components and authentication flow.

## Authentication State

To check if a user is authenticated, you can use the `authState` variable from the `TurnkeyContext`.

```kotlin
val authState: AuthState = TurnkeyContext.authState.value
```

## Customize sub-organization creation

Need to configure default user names, passkey names, wallet creations or anything sub-org related?
You can learn more about customizing the sub-orgs you create in the [Sub-Organization Customization](/sdks/kotlin/sub-organization-customization) section.
