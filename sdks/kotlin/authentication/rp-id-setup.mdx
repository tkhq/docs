## Overview

This guide explains how to set up the relying party ID (`rpId`) for passkey authentication in your Android app.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create or locate your debug keystore">
        Most Android development environments automatically create a debug keystore for you. It is typically located at:
        ```bash
         ~/.android/debug.keystore
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Extract the SHA-256 fingerprint from your debug keystore">
        Use the following command to extract the SHA-256 fingerprint:
        ```bash
        keytool -list -v \
            -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
            -alias androiddebugkey \
            -storepass android \
            -keypass android
        ```
        Look for the line that starts with `SHA256:` and copy the fingerprint.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the assetlinks.json file">
        Create a file named `assetlinks.json` with the following content, replacing `<YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT>` with the fingerprint you extracted in the previous step and `<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>` with your app's package name:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "relation": [
                "delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls",
                "delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"
            ],
            "target": {
              "namespace": "android_app",
              "package_name": "android.package.name",
              "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
                "<YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT>"
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
        ```
        
        Replace: 
        * `android.package.name` with your actual package name.
        * `<YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT>` with the SHA-256 fingerprint you obtained earlier.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Host the assetlinks.json file">
        Host the `assetlinks.json` file at the following URL on your domain:
        ```
        https://<your-domain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json
        ```
        Ensure that the file is publicly accessible.

        <Note>
            The simplest way to deploy your Digital Asset Links file for local development is to set up a simple static file server and use a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to expose it over HTTPS.
            For production, you can deploy the file on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or any static file hosting service that supports HTTPS.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify the setup">
        You can verify that your `assetlinks.json` file is correctly set up by visiting the following URL in your browser:
        ```
        https://<your-domain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json
        ```
        You should see the contents of your `assetlinks.json` file. Additionally, you can use online tools to validate your Digital Asset Links setup.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Link your app to the domain">
        Once the file is publicly available, Android will verify your app's association with the domain by matching your app's package name and certificate fingerprint to the values listed in the `assetlinks.json` file.

        <Note>
            The **domain** in `https://<domain>` is your relying party ID (`rpId`). Ensure that this domain matches the `rpId` you set in your Turnkey SDK config.
