description: "`@turnkey/core` is the core TypeScript client-side SDK for Turnkey's Embedded Wallets. It provides a set of functions and utilities to interact with Turnkey's APIs, a powerful session management system, built-in stampers, and a raw HTTP client for advanced use cases. This SDK is designed to be used as a foundation for building Turnkey's Embedded Wallets in various frontend frameworks, including React, React-native (alpha), Angular, Vue, and Svelte. If you're using React, please consider using the [`@turnkey/react-wallet-kit`](/sdks/react/) for a more tailored experience."
