## Triggering Authentication

You can call the specific login or signup methods you want to support. For example, with passkeys:

```ts
// Log in with a passkey
const session = await turnkeyClient.loginWithPasskey();

// Or sign up with a passkey
const session = await turnkeyClient.signUpWithPasskey();
```

Here's an example using email OTP:

```ts
// Log in with email OTP
import { OtpType } from "@turnkey/core";

cosnt otpId = await turnkeyClient.initOtp({ otpType: OtpType.Email, contact: "email@example.com" })
const session = await turnkeyClient.completeOtp({
        otpId,
        otpCode: 123456, // The code the user received via email or SMS
        contact: "email@example.com",
        otpType: OtpType.Email,
    });
```

Sessions will be automatically created and stored in the browser's local storage or mobile async storage on React Native.

## Checking Authentication State

To check if a user is authenticated, call `client.getSession()` and verify the expiry:

```ts
const session = await turnkeyClient.getSession();

if (session && session.expiry \* 1000 > Date.now()) {
    console.log("User is authenticated:", session);
} else {
    console.log("User is not authenticated");
}
```

If the session is expired or the user is done with their session, you can log them out:

```ts
await turnkeyClient.logout();
```
