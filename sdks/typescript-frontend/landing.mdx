## @turnkey/core

`@turnkey/core` is the core TypeScript client-side SDK for Turnkey's Embedded Wallets. It provides a set of functions and utilities to interact with Turnkey's APIs, a powerful session management system, built-in stampers, and a raw HTTP client for advanced use cases. This SDK is designed to be used as a foundation for building Turnkey's Embedded Wallets in various frontend frameworks, including React, React-native (alpha), Angular, Vue, and Svelte. If you're using React, please consider using the [`@turnkey/react-wallet-kit`](/sdks/react/) for a more tailored experience.

Head over to the [Getting Started](/sdks/typescript-frontend/getting-started) guide to set up your app with Turnkey's Embedded Wallets.

## @turnkey/sdk-browser (LEGACY)

`@turnkey/sdk-browser` is our legacy browser SDK, which is still available for use but is not recommended for new projects.

This package will soon be discontinued, if you're starting a new project, we recommend using the `@turnkey/react-wallet-kit` or `@turnkey/core` instead.

For more information on `@turnkey/sdk-browser`, see the [Legacy Guide](/sdks/typescript-frontend/legacy).
