  **Beta Feature & Security Notice**: This feature is currently in **Beta**. The API may change as we gather feedback and improve the implementation. Additionally, the gas station contracts are in the process of being audited and should be used at your own discretion.

The Gas Station SDK enables you to implement gasless transactions using EIP-7702 delegation and EIP-712 signed intents. This SDK is designed to work with Turnkey-managed paymaster wallets within your organization, allowing you to sponsor transactions for your users so they can execute transactions without needing ETH for gas fees.

While your paymaster wallet should be managed by Turnkey, the user wallets signing the EIP-712 intents can be flexible - they can be Turnkey-managed or external wallets. Your Turnkey paymaster can broadcast intents signed by any compatible wallet. The SDK provides clean abstractions for EIP-7702 authorization, intent signing, and paymaster execution, supporting any onchain action through generic execution parameters.

The SDK also includes robust policy building utilities that simplify the process of creating Turnkey policies. These utilities help you restrict EIP-712 intent signing for user wallets and implement paymaster guard policies to control what transactions your paymaster will sponsor.
