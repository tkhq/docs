<Warning>
  **Beta Feature & Security Notice**: This feature is currently in **Beta**. The API may change as we gather feedback and improve the implementation. Additionally, the gas station contracts are currently **un-audited** and should be used at your own discretion.
</Warning>

The Gas Station SDK enables you to implement gasless transactions using EIP-7702 delegation and EIP-712 signed intents. This allows users to execute transactions without needing ETH for gas fees, while you bring your own paymaster to sponsor the transactions.

The SDK provides clean abstractions for EIP-7702 authorization, intent signing, and paymaster execution. It integrates seamlessly with Turnkey's secure wallet management infrastructure and supports any on-chain action through generic execution parameters. Perfect for building dApps where users don't need ETH for gas, enabling seamless onboarding and better UX.
