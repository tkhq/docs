The Embedded Wallet Kit makes authentication simple.
You can call specific login and signup functions to create your own UI components and authentication flow.

## Authentication State

To check if a user is authenticated, you can use the `authState` variable from the `useTurnkey` hook.

```tsx
import { useTurnkey, AuthState } from "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit";

function AuthStatus() {
  const { authState, user, handleLogin } = useTurnkey();

  return (
    <div>
      {authState === AuthState.Authenticated ? (
        <p>Welcome back, {user?.userName}!</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={handleLogin}>Log in</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can also set up an `onAuthenticationSuccess` callback passed in through the `TurnkeyProvider` to handle post-authentication logic, such as redirecting.

```tsx
<TurnkeyProvider
  config={turnkeyConfig}
  callbacks={{
    onAuthenticationSuccess: ({ session }) => {
      console.log("User authenticated:", session);
      router.push("/dashboard");
    },
  }}
>
  {children}
</TurnkeyProvider>
```
