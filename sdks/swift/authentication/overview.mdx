## Configuration

Before implementing any specific method, make sure you've:

- Completed the Swift SDK [Getting started](/sdks/swift/getting-started) guide
- Configured `TurnkeyContext` with your `organizationId` and (if using Auth Proxy) `authProxyConfigId`
- Set `rpId` and Associated Domains if you plan to use Passkeys
- Optionally enabled managed auto-refresh for session state (`autoRefreshManagedState`)

Sessions created by the SDK's auth flows are securely stored and selected automatically; you can also switch or clear sessions via `TurnkeyContext` APIs when needed.

## Sessions

The Swift SDK generates an on-device API key pair to back your session:

- When available, keys are created in the Secure Enclave and the private key material remains non-exportable and hardware-backed. Signing operations occur inside the enclave.
- If the Secure Enclave isn't available on the device, the SDK falls back to secure storage using the iOS Keychain with appropriate access control.

This design aligns with Apple's guidance on Secure Enclave and Keychain Services. For terminology and security properties, see Apple documentation:

- [Secure Enclave](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/storing_keys_in_the_secure_enclave)
- [Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services)

## Authentication state

Use the shared `TurnkeyContext` to observe authentication and react in your UI by observing the `authState` property.

```swift focus={5,9-10,12,20-24}
import SwiftUI
import TurnkeySwift

struct AuthStatusView: View {
  @EnvironmentObject private var turnkey: TurnkeyContext

  var body: some View {
    Group {
      switch turnkey.authState {
      case .authenticated:
        Text("Welcome back!")
      case .loading:
        ProgressView()
      default:
        Button("Log in") {
          // Navigate to your auth flow (OTP, Passkey, or OAuth)
        }
      }
    }
    .onChange(of: turnkey.authState) { newState in
      if newState == .authenticated {
        // e.g., navigate to dashboard
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The context publishes key pieces of state (e.g., `authState`, `session`, `user`, `wallets`), so your views can stay reactive and minimal.

## Customize sub-organization creation

You can tailor default user and wallet creation settings by:

- Passing `CreateSubOrgParams` to signup helpers (e.g., OTP or passkey signup), or
- Providing defaults via `TurnkeyConfig.Auth.createSuborgParams`

For more information, see [Sub-organization customization](/sdks/swift/sub-organization-customization) and for concepts, see [Sub-organizations](/concepts/sub-organizations).
