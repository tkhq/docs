## Choose your authentication path

Decide whether you'll use Turnkey's managed Auth Proxy (no backend required) or route auth through your own server.

- **No backend (Auth Proxy)**

  - Your app talks directly to Turnkey's Auth Proxy for OTP, OAuth, and signup.
  - Origin validation, CORS, session lifetimes, and templates are centrally managed in the Dashboard.
  - Proxy keys are HPKE-encrypted and decrypted only in-memory per request inside Turnkey's enclave.
  - The frontend calls Auth Proxy endpoints directly — no backend endpoints needed for OTP, OAuth, or signup flows.
  - See the full details in the [Auth Proxy reference](/reference/auth-proxy).

- **Your backend**
  - Implement OTP, OAuth, and signup on your server using Turnkey's public API.
  - Keep custom validations, logging, and rate-limiting in your control; store user metadata alongside sub-orgs.
  - Enable co-signing patterns (e.g., 2/2) from your backend.
  - Follow the Swift guide: [Advanced backend authentication](/sdks/swift/authentication/advanced-backend-authentication).

Note: The Swift SDK's high-level auth helpers on `TurnkeyContext` (e.g., `initOtp`, `verifyOtp`, `completeOtp`, `handleGoogleOAuth`, `handleAppleOAuth`, `handleDiscordOAuth`, `handleXOauth`, and `signUpWithPasskey`) call the Auth Proxy and require an `authProxyConfigId`.
If you are using your own backend, omit `authProxyConfigId` in `TurnkeyContext.configure` and use your server endpoints; after your server returns a session JWT, store it via `TurnkeyContext.storeSession(...)`.

## Configuration

Before implementing any specific method, make sure you've:

- Completed the Swift SDK [Getting started](/sdks/swift/getting-started) guide
- Configured `TurnkeyContext` with your `organizationId` and (if using Auth Proxy) `authProxyConfigId`
- Set `rpId` and Associated Domains if you plan to use Passkeys
- Optionally enabled managed auto-refresh for session state (`autoRefreshManagedState`)

Sessions created by the SDK's auth flows are securely stored and selected automatically; you can also switch or clear sessions via `TurnkeyContext` APIs when needed.

## Persisting sessions

The Swift SDK generates an on-device API key pair to back your session:

- When available, keys are created in the Secure Enclave and the private key material remains non-exportable and hardware-backed. Signing operations occur inside the enclave, via enclave-to-enclave communication within Turnkey's infrastructure.
- If the Secure Enclave isn't available on the device, the SDK falls back to secure storage using the iOS Keychain with appropriate access control.

This design aligns with Apple's guidance on Secure Enclave and Keychain Services. For terminology and security properties, see Apple documentation:

- [Secure Enclave](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/storing_keys_in_the_secure_enclave)
- [Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services)

## Authentication state

Use the shared `TurnkeyContext` to observe authentication and react in your UI by observing the `authState` property.

In the Swift SDK, `AuthState` represents where you are in the authentication lifecycle:

- **Loading**: set while the context is initializing. At this point, the SDK hasn't yet determined whether a valid session exists.
- **Authenticated**: set as soon as a valid session is detected and the client is configured to make authenticated requests to Turnkey.
- **Unauthenticated**: set once the SDK determines no session exists.

```swift focus={5,9-10,12,20-24}
import SwiftUI
import TurnkeySwift

struct AuthStatusView: View {
  @EnvironmentObject private var turnkey: TurnkeyContext

  var body: some View {
    Group {
      switch turnkey.authState {
      case .authenticated:
        Text("Welcome back!")
      case .loading:
        ProgressView()
      default:
        Button("Log in") {
          // Navigate to your auth flow (OTP, Passkey, or OAuth)
        }
      }
    }
    .onChange(of: turnkey.authState) { newState in
      if newState == .authenticated {
        // e.g., navigate to dashboard
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The context publishes key pieces of state (e.g., `authState`, `session`, `user`, `wallets`), so your views can stay reactive and minimal.

## Customize sub-organization creation

You can tailor default user and wallet creation settings by:

- Passing `CreateSubOrgParams` to signup helpers (e.g., OTP or passkey signup), or
- Providing defaults via `TurnkeyConfig.Auth.createSuborgParams`

For more information, see [Sub-organization customization](/sdks/swift/sub-organization-customization).
