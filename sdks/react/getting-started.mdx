## Turnkey organization setup

To start, you must create a Turnkey organization via the [Turnkey dashboard](https://app.turnkey.com). The steps to do so are described in the [Account Setup](/getting-started/quickstart) section.

For this setup, we will be using Turnkey's Auth Proxy to handle authentication. We can enable and configure this through the Turnkey dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auth Proxy">
    Navigate to the **Wallet Kit** section in the Turnkey Dashboard and enable the
    **Auth Proxy**.

    <img
      src="/images/getting-started/img/quickstart/auth-proxy-toggle.png"
      alt="Auth Proxy toggle"
    />

  </Step>

    <Step title="Customize auth methods">

    You can choose which auth methods to enable and customize various options from this screen. For this quickstart, let's enable **email OTP** and **passkeys**. When you're done, click **Save**.


    <img
      src="/images/getting-started/img/quickstart/auth-proxy-options.png"
      alt="Auth Proxy options"
    />

    <img
      src="/images/getting-started/img/quickstart/wallet-kit-options.png"
      alt="Wallet kit options"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Finish up">

    Once you're finished with the auth proxy setup, you can copy the **auth proxy config ID**

    <img
      src="/images/getting-started/img/quickstart/auth-proxy-id.png"
      alt="Auth Proxy Config id"
    />

and your **organization ID** from the dashboard.

  <img
      src="/images/getting-started/img/quickstart/org-id.png"
      alt="Organization id"
    />
  These will be used in the next steps to configure your app.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

You can use `@turnkey/react-wallet-kit` in any React based web application.

For this guide, let's create a new `Next.js` app. If you already have an existing app, you don't need to do this.

```bash npx
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Now, install the Turnkey React Wallet Kit package:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @turnkey/react-wallet-kit
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @turnkey/react-wallet-kit
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @turnkey/react-wallet-kit
```

</CodeGroup>

Finally, create a `.env` file within your app directory, and populate it with the **IDs** from before

```bash .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID="here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROXY_CONFIG_ID="and_here"
```

## Provider

Wrap your app with the `TurnkeyProvider` component, and import `"@turnkey/react-wallet-kit/styles.css"` to include styles for the UI components.

<Info>
  **For Tailwind CSS V3 users:**
    
  Please refer to the [Tailwind V3 error](./troubleshooting#6-%40layer-utilities-is-used-but-no-matching-%40tailwind-utilities-directive-is-present-tailwind-v3-error) in the [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) section for specific instructions on how to import the styles correctly.

You can continue with the guide as normal if you are using **Tailwind CSS V4** or **not using Tailwind CSS at all**.

</Info>

With Next.js App Router, keep `app/layout.tsx` as a server component and create a separate `app/providers.tsx` client wrapper. This is necessary if you want to pass callbacks (e.g., onError), which must be defined in a client component.

```tsx app/providers.tsx
"use client";

import {
  TurnkeyProvider,
  TurnkeyProviderConfig,
} from "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit";

const turnkeyConfig: TurnkeyProviderConfig = {
  organizationId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID!,
  authProxyConfigId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROXY_CONFIG_ID!,
};

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <TurnkeyProvider
    config={turnkeyConfig}
    callbacks={{
      onError: (error) => console.error("Turnkey error:", error),
    }}
  >{children}</TurnkeyProvider>;
}
```

In case anything goes wrong, we've added an `onError` callback to the `TurnkeyProvider` to catch any errors.


Then, use the `Providers` component to wrap your app in `app/layout.tsx`.

```tsx app/layout.tsx
import "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit/styles.css";
import "./globals.css";
import { Providers } from "./providers";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

> **Why this pattern?**
>
> - Callbacks (and other interactive bits) must be declared in a client component.
> - Keeping layout.tsx as a server component maintains optimal rendering and avoids unnecessarily making your entire app client-side.
> - Centralizing Turnkey setup in app/providers.tsx keeps configuration, styles, and callbacks in one place.

## Client Readiness

The `ClientState` enum tracks the initialization status of the Turnkey client. Before performing any auth or wallet operations, you must wait for the client to reach it's `Ready` state

### `ClientState` Values

```ts
export enum ClientState {
  Loading = "loading",
  Ready = "ready",
  Error = "error",
}
```

### Why Client Readiness Matters

The client performs several asynchronous operations during initialization:

1. Configuration Loading - Fetches auth proxy config if configured
2. TurnkeyClient Initialization - Sets up the HTTP client, passkey, api key & wallet stampers, and wallet providers
3. Session Restoration - Loads and validates existing sessions from storage
4. Wallet Provider Setup - Initializes wallet connection listeners

Calling methods before Ready can cause:

* Race conditions with session management
* Missing configuration errors
* Failed client operations

### How To Check Client Readiness

Access `clientState` via the `useTurnkey` hook:

```ts
import { ClientState, AuthState, useTurnkey } from "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  const { clientState, authState } = useTurnkey();

  // Show loading spinner while client initializes
  if (clientState === undefined || clientState === ClientState.Loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  // Handle client initialization errors
  if (clientState === ClientState.Error) {
    return <ErrorMessage />;
  }

  // Client is ready - render your UI
  return <Content />;
}
```

### More Advanced Usage

We can take this a step further and automatically pop-open the auth component when the client is ready and the user is unauthenticated:

```ts
import { ClientState, AuthState, useTurnkey } from "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  const { handleLogin, clientState, authState } = useTurnkey();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only trigger login when client is ready AND user is unauthenticated
    if (
      clientState === ClientState.Ready &&
      authState === AuthState.Unauthenticated
    ) {
      handleLogin();
    }
  }, [clientState]);

  // Handle different states
  if (clientState === undefined || clientState === ClientState.Loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  if (clientState === ClientState.Error) {
    return <ErrorMessage />;
  }

  // Client is ready - render your authenticated UI
  return <Content />;
}
```

<Note>

</Note>

The client starts as undefined, moves to Loading during initialization, then settles on either Ready (success) or Error (failure).
