## @turnkey/react-wallet-kit

The `@turnkey/react-wallet-kit` is a powerful SDK that allows you to integrate Turnkey's Embedded Wallets into your React applications. It provides a set of UI components and easy-to-use functions, all exported from a hook, enabling you to quickly build secure embedded wallet experiences. This is our latest React SDK, currently in beta, and it is built on top of the `@turnkey/core` SDK.

Head over to the [Getting Started](/sdks/react/getting-started) guide to set up your React app with Turnkey's Embedded Wallets.

## @turnkey/sdk-react (LEGACY)

`@turnkey/sdk-react` is our legacy React SDK, which is still available for use but is not recommended for new projects. It is built off `@turnkey/sdk-browser` and provides direct integration with Turnkey's API into React applications.

This package will soon be discontinued, if you're starting a new project, we recommend using the `@turnkey/react-wallet-kit` instead.

For more information on `@turnkey/sdk-react`, see the [Legacy Guide](/sdks/react/legacy).
