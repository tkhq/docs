## Overview

The `@turnkey/react-wallet-kit` provides a wide variety of helper functions to abstract interactions with Turnkey's infrastructure. However, you can also make advanced API requests directly to Turnkey's endpoints if you need more control or want to implement custom features.

## The HTTP Client

To make advanced API requests, you can use the `httpClient` provided by the `useTurnkey` hook. This client is tied to the active session meaning stamping and organization context are automatically handled for you.

You can see the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview) for a complete list of available API endpoints and their parameters. All of these can be accessed through the `httpClient`.

Here's how you can use the `httpClient` to make a `signRawPayload` request to Turnkey:

```tsx
import { useTurnkey } from "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit";

function SignRawPayloadButton() {
  const { httpClient, wallets } = useTurnkey();

  const doSignRawPayload = async () => {
    try {
      const signWith = wallets[0]?.accounts[0].address; // Use the address of the first account of the first wallet
      const message = "Hello, Turnkey!";

      const hashedMessage = Buffer.from(message, "utf8").toString("hex"); // Convert message to hex format

      const response = await httpClient.signRawPayload({
        signWith,
        payload: hashedMessage,
        encoding: "PAYLOAD_ENCODING_HEXADECIMAL",
        hashFunction: "HASH_FUNCTION_NOT_APPLICABLE",
      });

      const signature = {response.r, response.s, response.v}; // Extract the signature from the response

      console.log("Message signed:", signature);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error signing message:", error);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={doSignRawPayload}>Sign Message</button>;
}
```

## Viewing the Activity

When creating, modifying, or using resources within Turnkey, an activity is created. You can learn more about activities in the [Activities](/api-reference/activities/overview) section.

If you use the `httpClient`, you can view all the metadata of the activity you are performing. This includes the activity ID, votes list, status, and more.

```tsx
const response = await httpClient?.updateWallet({
  walletId: "a-wallet-id-123",
  walletName: "New wallet name",
});

const { id, votes, status } = response?.activity!;
```

## Using Other Stampers

By default, the `httpClient` will use a securely stored API key to stamp requests to Turnkey. You can switch this to use a **passkey** or **external wallet** by passing in a `StamperType` to the `httpClient` functions. The user will be prompted to sign using the selected method before the request is made.

For example, to use a passkey to stamp the `signRawPayload` request, simply pass in `StamperType.Passkey` as the second argument:

```tsx
import { useTurnkey, StamperType } from "@turnkey/react-wallet-kit";

const response = await httpClient.signRawPayload(
  {
    signWith,
    payload: hashedMessage,
    encoding: "PAYLOAD_ENCODING_HEXADECIMAL",
    hashFunction: "HASH_FUNCTION_NOT_APPLICABLE",
  },
  StamperType.Passkey // Use a passkey to stamp this request
);
```
