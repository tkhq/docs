# Turnkey Python SDK

This repository contains support for interacting with the Turnkey API using Python.

Unlike other languages ([Typescript](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk), [Ruby](https://github.com/tkhq/ruby-sdk)), we do not yet offer a full SDK for Rust.

If you are working on a project in Python and would benefit from a Python SDK please open an issue or get in touch with us at [hello@turnkey.com](mailto:hello@turnkey.com) to discuss prioritizing this.

## Stamper

The Stamper utility stamps requests to the Turnkey API and authenticates your calls. To use it, fill out the fields at the top of the stamper script:

```python
ENDPOINT = "https://api.turnkey.com/public/v1/whoami"
API_PUBLIC_KEY = "<Your Turnkey API Public Key (02xx)>"
API_PRIVATE_KEY = "<Your Turnkey API Private Key>"
ORG_ID = "<Your Organization ID>"
```

You can find the script and examples in the [python-sdk repo](https://github.com/tkhq/python-sdk).
