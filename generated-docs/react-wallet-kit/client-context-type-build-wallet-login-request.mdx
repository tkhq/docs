<H3Bordered text="Overview" />

Builds and signs a wallet login request without submitting it to Turnkey.

<ul>
  <li>This function prepares a signed request for wallet authentication, which can later be used</li>
</ul>

to log in or sign up a user with Turnkey.

<ul>
  <li>It initializes the wallet stamper, ensures a valid session public key (generating one if needed),</li>
</ul>

and signs the login intent with the connected wallet.

<ul>
  <li>For Ethereum wallets, derives the public key from the stamped request header.</li>
  <li>For Solana wallets, retrieves the public key directly from the connected wallet.</li>
  <li>The signed request is not sent to Turnkey immediately; it is meant to be used in a subsequent flow</li>
</ul>

(e.g., ``loginOrSignupWithWallet``) where sub-organization existence is verified or created first.
