<H3Bordered text="Overview" />

Fetches the boot proof for a given app proof.

<ul>
  <li>This function is idempotent: multiple calls with the same ``app proof`` will always return the boot proof.</li>
  <li>Attempts to find the boot proof for the given app proof.</li>
  <li>If a boot proof is found, it is returned as is.</li>
  <li>If no boot proof is found, an error is thrown.</li>
</ul>

<H3Bordered text="Parameters" />

<ParamField body="params" type='FetchBootProofForAppProofParams' required={true} />

<H3Bordered text="Response" />
A successful response returns the following fields:

<ResponseField name="returns" type="v1BootProof" required={true}>
  A promise that resolves to the v1BootProof associated with the given app proof.
</ResponseField>
