## What is a session?

Such actions can be divided into two buckets:

* Read operations: Retrieving data (e.g., viewing wallet balances)
* Write operations: Modifying data or performing sensitive actions (e.g., signing transactions)

## How can I create a session?

### Read-only sessions

In terms of end-user experience, a read-only session might make sense in low-touch applications where users are primarily reading data (think viewing wallets and their balances). As for implementation, there are a few ways a developer can achieve read-only access on behalf of a user. Note: an end-user (sub-organization) falls hierarchically under the developer (parent-organization).

#### Parent organization access

By default, a parent organization has read access to all of its sub-organizations’ data. This means you can set up a federated model where the client makes requests to a backend (containing the parent organization’s API key credentials), the backend populates the requested data, and returns it back to the client. From an implementation perspective, each read request (i.e. `get` or `list`) requires an `organizationId` parameter. Populate that field with the sub-organization’s ID in order to get its data.

#### Client side access

Separately, if you would like the client to have all read requests encapsulated (instead of reading data via a proxy like in the previous approach), the client can initiate a read-only session via a [CreateReadOnlySession activity](/api-reference/sessions/create-read-only-session). This activity returns a session string that, if passed into an HTTP request via `X-Session` header, gives permission to perform reads. Note that because this is an activity performed by an end-user, it requires authentication (e.g. via passkey).

If you’d like to do this via our SDK abstractions, you can leverage the [login](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/6b3ea14d1184c5394449ecaad2b0f445e373823f/packages/sdk-browser/src/sdk-client.ts#L231-L255)1 method, which creates a `CreateReadOnlySession` activity under the hood. It stores the resulting session string in [Local Storage](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/6b3ea14d1184c5394449ecaad2b0f445e373823f/packages/sdk-browser/src/sdk-client.ts#L242-L252)2, and subsequent requests to fetch data from Turnkey injects the session stored here at [call time](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/6b3ea14d1184c5394449ecaad2b0f445e373823f/packages/sdk-browser/src/__generated__/sdk-client-base.ts#L45-L47)3 within `@turnkey/sdk-browser`.

### Read-write sessions

In contrast to read-only sessions, a read-write session makes sense when a user would like to make several authenticated write requests in a window of time. There are a few ways to achieve this:

#### Creating a read-write session

There are several mechanisms to obtain read-write sessions: OTP, OAuth, Passkey sessions, and Session refreshing

Our SDK contains several abstractions that manage authentication. You can checkout all of our examples leveraging these examples [here](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples)

**Note:** The session JWT is only metadata signed by Turnkey that references the client side stored API keypair, and is useful for verifying the session server-side or associating metadata, but it cannot be used to authenticate requests to Turnkey’s API. 
Only the session keypair can be used to create valid `x-stamp` signatures for API requests to Turnkey. In other words, solely the session JWT cannot be used to stamp requests outside of the client context.

### Mechanisms

There are two primary mechanisms we offer that provide client side key generation and signing to support read-write sessions.

#### IndexedDB (web only):

For web apps that want stronger session persistence without relying on iframes or exposing credentials to your app’s JavaScript runtime, Turnkey supports using the [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) API to generate unextractable asymmetric key pairs and store them securely in the browser’s IndexedDB.

This approach enables long-lived, client-held sessions that survive page reloads, tab closures, and even browser restarts – **without ever exposing the private key** to your JavaScript code.

Turnkey’s SDK provides helpers to:
- Create a new session by generating a P-256 key pair via `crypto.subtle.generateKey()`
- Sign requests
- Store and retrieve the key using IndexedDB under a given session ID
- Abstractions built on top of the `IndexedDBStamper` that simplify authentication flows 

This is currently the **most persistent** session model for modern browsers that support WebCrypto. It is especially valuable in Progressive Web App (PWA) contexts or when iframe and Local Storage approaches are insufficient.

To see a full working example, check out our [IndexedDB SDK example](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-indexed-db). Or our [Web demo application](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-ewk) that leverages abstractions such as the `IndexedDbClient` for full end-to-end authentication flows.


#### SecureStorage (mobile only)

Secure Storage operates essentially the same as IndexedDB with respect to authentication flows for Turnkey except it is mobile native and keys are generated using @turnkey/crypto rather than WebCrypto. 

#### LocalStorage:

Another option is to create an API key and store it directly within Local Storage. However, this is a riskier setup than IndexedDb/SecureStorage as anyone who is able to access this client-side API key has full access to a User.

### Sessions FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I refresh a session?">
    Once a user has a valid session, it is trivial to use that session to create a new session. The `refreshSession` abstraction will create a brand new session and automatically store the resulting new session in local storage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I delete a session?">
    In order to delete a session, simply remove all user-related artifacts from Local Storage.

    ```ts
    /**
      * Clears out all data pertaining to a user session.
      *
      * @returns {Promise<boolean>}
      */
      logout = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
        await removeStorageValue(StorageKeys.Client);
        await removeStorageValue(StorageKeys.Session);
        return true;
      };
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long are sessions?">
    The expiration of session keys can be specified to any amount of time using the `expirationSeconds` parameter. The default length is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many session keys can be active at once?">
    A user can have up to 10 expiring API keys at any given time. If you create an expiring API key that exceeds that limit, Turnkey automatically deletes one of your existing keys using the following priority:

    * Expired API keys are deleted first
    * If no expired keys exist, the oldest unexpired key is deleted
If you are looking to invalidate existing sessions, you can use the `invalidateExisting` parameter for all `_LOGIN` activities. This will clear all existing session keys.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same sessions implementation for web and mobile?">
    Absolutely! Through leveraging IndexedDb you can handle sessions in the same way for Web and PWAs. However, for React Native/Mobile applications you will need to leverage Secure Storage.
