## Passkey flow

A typical passkey flow is composed of 4 main steps, depicted below:

</Frame>

1. Your app frontend triggers a passkey prompt.
2. Your end-user uses their device to produce a signature with their passkey, and a signed request is produced.
3. The signed request is forwarded to your backend. This step is optional, see ["To Proxy or not to proxy"](#proxying-signed-requests) below for more information.
4. The signed request is verified within a Turnkey secure enclave.

This flow happens once for **registration** and for each subsequent **authentication** or signature request. The main difference is the browser APIs used to trigger the passkey prompt in step (1):

* **Passkey registration** uses `navigator.credentials.create`(as described in [this guide](https://web.dev/passkey-registration/)). `navigator.credentials.create` triggers the creation of a **new** passkey.
* **Passkey authentication** uses `navigator.credentials.get`. See [this guide](https://web.dev/passkey-form-autofill/) for more information. `navigator.credentials.get` triggers a signature prompt for an **existing** passkey.

## Our SDK can help

Our SDK has integrated passkey functionality, and we've built examples to help you get started.

* [`@turnkey/http`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/http) has a helper to trigger passkey registration (`getWebAuthnAttestation`). You can see it in action in our [`with-federated-passkeys`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-federated-passkeys) example: [direct code link](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/a2bfbf3cbd6040902bbe4c247900ac560be42925/examples/with-federated-passkeys/src/pages/index.tsx#L88)

* [`@turnkey/webauthn-stamper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/webauthn-stamper) is a passkey-compatible stamper which integrates seamlessly with `TurnkeyClient`:

```ts
import { WebauthnStamper } from "@turnkey/webauthn-stamper";
import { TurnkeyClient, createActivityPoller } from "@turnkey/http";

const stamper = new WebauthnStamper({
  rpId: "your.app.xyz",
});

// New HTTP client able to sign with passkeys
const httpClient = new TurnkeyClient(
  { baseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com" },
  stamper
);

// This will produce a signed request that can be POSTed from anywhere.
// The `signedRequest` has a URL, a POST body, and a "stamp" (HTTP header name and value)
const signedRequest = await httpClient.stampCreatePrivateKeys(...)

// Alternatively, you can POST directly from your frontend.
// Our HTTP client will use the webauthn stamper and the configured baseUrl automatically!
const activityPoller = createActivityPoller({
  client: client,
  requestFn: client.createPrivateKeys,
});

// Contains the activity result; no backend proxy needed!
const completedActivity = await activityPoller({
  type: "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_PRIVATE_KEYS_V2",
  // (omitting the rest of this for brevity)
})
```

* [`@turnkey/viem`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/viem) is a package wrapping all of the above so that you work directly with Viem without worrying about passkeys. See [this demo](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-viem-and-passkeys).

Regardless of whether you use our helpers and abstractions, take a look at [our registration and authentication options guide](/authentication/passkeys/options). This will help you choose the right options for your passkey flow.

If you have questions, feedback, or find yourself in need of an abstraction or integration that doesn't exist yet, please get in touch with us! You can

* Create an [issue on our SDK repo](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/issues)

We're here to make this as easy as possible for you and your team!

## Passkey wallets with sub-organizations

If you're wondering how to create independent, non-custodial wallets for your end-users, head to [Sub-Organizations](/concepts/sub-organizations). In short: you'll be able to pass the registered passkeys as part of a "create sub-organization" activity, making your end-users the sole owners of any resource created within the sub-organization (including private keys). Your organization will only have read permissions.
