## Introduction

After authenticating with one of the various authentication methods a user, in many cases, will then make requests the Turnkey API with an API key. 
An API key has a `Credential` field which stores the public key and the type of the credential. Because these API keys can be obtained in many different ways, 
for example [SMS OTP](/authentication/sms), [Email Authentication](/authentication/email), or through an [OAuth](/authentication/social-logins) provider like google, Turnkey differentiates these API keys through the `Credential` type.
This helps distinguish what types of authentication methods a user has used, and how they have obtained an API key to make requests to the Turnkey API with.

[Passkey's](/authentication/passkeys/introduction), known as authenticators within the context of Turnkey, also have the same `Credential` field and are equally distinguished by the credential type.

## Obtaining an API key's credential type

To obtain an API key's credential type you can use the [GetAPIKey](/api-reference/queries/get-api-key) query. The API Key fields will be returned from this call and the credential `type` will be within it. This will return an object that looks like:
```sh
{
   "apiKey": {
      "apiKeyId": "<api-key-id>",
      "apiKeyName": "<api-key-name>",
      "createdAt": {
         "nanos": "0",
         "seconds": "1752105687"
      },
      "credential": {
         "publicKey": "<api-key-public-key>",
         "type": "CREDENTIAL_TYPE_API_KEY_P256"
      },
      "updatedAt": {
         "nanos": "0",
         "seconds": "1752105687"
      }
   }
}
```

## Credential Types

The table below describes all of the different credential types and what authentication methods correspond to that credential type
