# Overview

Authentication methods are security mechanisms used to verify identity and authorize actions within the Turnkey platform. Unlike traditional password-based systems, Turnkey prioritizes stronger authentication methods that provide enhanced security while maintaining excellent user experience.

This guide covers all supported authentication methods, providing details on how to accommodate different security requirements and use cases.

## Supported Authentication Methods

Turnkey supports various authentication methods to accommodate different security requirements and use cases:

### WebAuthN/Passkeys

[WebAuthN](https://webauthn.guide/) provides a secure authentication standard using public key cryptography, enabling passwordless authentication through devices like biometric sensors and security keys.

For comprehensive information about implementing passkeys in your application, see our [Passkeys Introduction](/authentication/passkeys/introduction) guide.

#### Types of WebAuthN Devices

- **Platform Authenticators**: Built into the device (e.g., Touch ID, Face ID)
- **Cross-Platform Authenticators**: External devices (e.g., YubiKeys, other FIDO2 compliant security keys)

#### Supported Transport Methods

- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_BLE` - Bluetooth Low Energy
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_INTERNAL` - Device-integrated authenticators
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_NFC` - Near Field Communication
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_USB` - USB connection
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_HYBRID` - Multiple transport methods

Learn more about [passkey configuration options](/authentication/passkeys/options) and [integration best practices](/authentication/passkeys/integration).

#### Key Considerations for WebAuthN/Passkeys

- Every Turnkey user needs at least one long-lived credential (a passkey or non-expiring API key) to prevent account lockouts
- WebAuthN/passkeys are recommended for dashboard access and user authentication
- See our guide on [discoverable vs. non-discoverable credentials](/authentication/passkeys/discoverable-vs-non-discoverable) for important implementation details

**API Reference**: [Create Authenticators](/api-reference/authenticators/create-authenticators), [Get Authenticators](/api-reference/authenticators/get-authenticators)

### API Keys

API keys use asymmetric cryptography (P-256 key pairs) for programmatic access to the Turnkey API.

For backend implementation details, see our [Backend Setup](/authentication/backend-setup) guide.

#### Key Considerations for API Keys

- Turnkey only stores the public key; you are responsible for securely storing the private key
- API keys are primarily intended for programmatic/server access
- API key requests must include properly formatted signatures

**API Reference**: [Create API Keys](/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-keys), [Get API Keys](/api-reference/api-keys/get-api-key)

### Email Authentication

Email authentication provides a familiar and accessible method for users to authenticate, particularly useful for sub-organizations and embedded wallet implementations.

For detailed implementation instructions and examples, see our [Email Authentication](/authentication/email) guide.

#### Types of Email Authentication

- OTP-based Email Auth (one-time passwords)
- Credential bundle Email Auth

#### Key Considerations for Email Authentication

- Email authentication is enabled by default for sub-organizations
- Can be disabled during sub-organization creation if needed

**API Reference**: [Perform Email Auth](/api-reference/user-auth/perform-email-auth)

### SMS Authentication

SMS authentication uses phone numbers and one-time passwords sent via text message to verify user identity.

For implementation details and code examples, see our [SMS Authentication](/authentication/sms) guide.

#### Key Considerations for SMS Authentication

- Creates temporary API keys for session access
- Requires phone number verification
- Has rate limiting per user to prevent abuse

**API Reference**: [Init OTP Auth](/api-reference/user-auth/init-otp-auth), [OTP Auth](/api-reference/user-auth/otp-auth)

### OAuth Authentication (Beta)

Authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens from third-party identity providers.

Learn more about implementing social logins in our [Social Logins](/authentication/social-logins) documentation.

#### Key Considerations for OAuth Authentication

- Currently in Beta status
- Provides integration with existing identity systems

**API Reference**: [OAuth](/api-reference/user-auth/oauth), [Create OAuth Providers](/api-reference/user-auth/create-oauth-providers)

## Best Practices

- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Register multiple authentication methods to ensure account access if one method becomes unavailable
- **Security Considerations**: Different authentication methods offer various security levels; choose based on your security requirements
- **User Experience**: Balance security requirements with usability considerations
- **Recovery Planning**: Always have backup authentication methods configured

For information about managing authenticated sessions, see our [Sessions](/authentication/sessions) documentation.
