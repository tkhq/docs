# Overview

Authentication methods are security mechanisms used to verify identity and authorize actions within the Turnkey platform. Unlike traditional password-based systems, Turnkey prioritizes stronger authentication methods that provide enhanced security while maintaining excellent user experience.

This guide covers all supported authentication methods, providing details on how to add each type, along with specific considerations and best practices.

## Supported Authentication Methods

Turnkey supports various authentication methods to accommodate different security requirements and use cases:

### WebAuthN/Passkeys

[WebAuthN](https://webauthn.guide/) provides a secure authentication standard using public key cryptography, enabling passwordless authentication through devices like biometric sensors and security keys.

For comprehensive information about implementing passkeys in your application, see our [Passkeys Introduction](/authentication/passkeys/introduction) guide.

#### Types of WebAuthN Devices

- **Platform Authenticators**: Built into the device (e.g., Touch ID, Face ID)
- **Cross-Platform Authenticators**: External devices (e.g., YubiKeys, other FIDO2 compliant security keys)

#### Supported Transport Methods

- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_BLE` - Bluetooth Low Energy
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_INTERNAL` - Device-integrated authenticators
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_NFC` - Near Field Communication
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_USB` - USB connection
- `AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_HYBRID` - Multiple transport methods

#### How to Add WebAuthN/Passkeys

{/* Placeholder for WebAuthN authentication method addition steps */}

#### Notes and Considerations

- Every Turnkey user needs at least one long-lived credential (a passkey or non-expiring API key) to prevent account lockouts
- WebAuthN/passkeys are recommended for dashboard access and user authentication
- See our guide on [discoverable vs. non-discoverable credentials](/authentication/passkeys/discoverable-vs-non-discoverable) for important implementation details

### API Keys

API keys use asymmetric cryptography (P-256 key pairs) for programmatic access to the Turnkey API.

For backend implementation details, see our [Backend Setup](/authentication/backend-setup) guide.

#### How to Add an API Key

{/* Placeholder for API key creation steps */}

#### Notes and Considerations

- Turnkey only stores the public key; you are responsible for securely storing the private key
- API keys are primarily intended for programmatic/server access
- API key requests must include properly formatted signatures

### Email Authentication

Email authentication provides a familiar and accessible method for users to authenticate, particularly useful for sub-organizations and embedded wallet implementations.

For detailed implementation instructions and examples, see our [Email Authentication](/authentication/email) guide.

#### Types of Email Authentication

- OTP-based Email Auth (one-time passwords)
- Credential bundle Email Auth

#### How to Enable Email Authentication

{/* Placeholder for email authentication setup */}

#### Notes and Considerations

- Email authentication is enabled by default for sub-organizations
- Can be disabled during sub-organization creation if needed

### SMS Authentication

SMS authentication uses phone numbers and one-time passwords sent via text message to verify user identity.

For implementation details and code examples, see our [SMS Authentication](/authentication/sms) guide.

#### How to Enable SMS Authentication

{/* Placeholder for SMS authentication setup */}

#### Notes and Considerations

- Creates temporary API keys for session access
- Requires phone number verification
- Has rate limiting per user to prevent abuse

### OAuth Authentication (Beta)

Authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens from third-party identity providers.

#### How to Configure OAuth Authentication

{/* Placeholder for OAuth setup */}

#### Notes and Considerations

- Currently in Beta status
- Provides integration with existing identity systems

## Best Practices

- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Register multiple authentication methods to ensure account access if one method becomes unavailable
- **Security Considerations**: Different authentication methods offer various security levels; choose based on your security requirements
- **User Experience**: Balance security requirements with usability considerations
- **Recovery Planning**: Always have backup authentication methods configured

For information about managing authenticated sessions, see our [Sessions](/authentication/sessions) documentation.
