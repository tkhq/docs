title: "SMS Authentication"
description: "SMS authentication enables users to authenticate their Turnkey account using their phone number via a 6-digit one-time password (OTP). When authenticated, users receive an expiring API key stored in memory within an iframe, which functions like a session key to access their wallet."

## Access and Pricing

SMS authentication is available to all Enterprise customers. To enable this feature, please reach out to the Turnkey team.

SMS pricing is usage-based and varies depending on the country of the destination phone number. A downloadable price list for all supported countries is available <a href="/assets/files/sms-prices.csv" download>here as a CSV</a>.

## How It Works

SMS authentication uses two activities:

1. `INIT_OTP_AUTH` - sends a 6-digit OTP code to the specified phone number
2. `OTP_AUTH` - verifies the code and returns an encrypted API key credential

## Implementation

### Initiating SMS Authentication

To start SMS authentication, create an activity with `ACTIVITY_TYPE_INIT_OTP_AUTH` and the following parameters:

- `otpType`: must be set to `"OTP_TYPE_SMS"`
- `contact`: user's phone number (must be previously approved and attached to the user's organization data)
- `userIdentifier`: optional parameter for rate limiting SMS OTP requests per user.
  We recommend generating this server-side based on the user's IP address or public key.
  See the [OTP Rate Limits](#otp-rate-limits) section below for more details.

### Verifying the OTP

Once the user receives their code, use `ACTIVITY_TYPE_OTP_AUTH` with these parameters:

- `otpId`: ID from the `INIT_OTP_AUTH` response
- `otpCode`: the 6-digit code received via SMS
- `targetPublicKey`: public key for credential encryption
- `apiKeyName`: optional name for the API Key (defaults to `OTP Auth - <Timestamp>`)
- `expirationSeconds`: optional duration in seconds (defaults to 15 minutes)
- `invalidateExisting`: optional boolean to invalidate previous OTP Auth API keys

## Authorization

SMS authentication requires proper permissions through policies or parent organization status.

<Info>Non-paying accounts are limited to **50 SMS messages** per month.</Info>

## Enabling/Disabling SMS Auth

### For Top-level Organizations

SMS authentication is disabled by default. Enable it using `ACTIVITY_TYPE_SET_ORGANIZATION_FEATURE`:

```bash
turnkey request --host api.turnkey.com --path /public/v1/submit/set_organization_feature --body '{
        "timestampMs": "'"$(date +%s)"'000",
        "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_SET_ORGANIZATION_FEATURE",
        "organizationId": "<YOUR-ORG-ID>",
        "parameters": {
                "name": "FEATURE_NAME_SMS_AUTH"
        }
}' --organization <YOUR-ORG-ID>
```

### For Sub-organizations

- SMS auth is enabled by default
- Disable during creation using `disableSmsAuth: true` in the `CreateSubOrganizationIntentV7` activity
- Disable after creation using `ACTIVITY_TYPE_REMOVE_ORGANIZATION_FEATURE` with feature name `FEATURE_NAME_SMS_AUTH`

## Implementation Notes

- Users are limited to 10 long-lived API keys and 10 expiring API keys
- When the expiring API key limit is reached, the oldest key is automatically discarded

## OTP Rate Limits

In order to safeguard users, Turnkey enforces rate limits for OTP auth activities. If a `userIdentifier` parameter is provided, the following limits are enforced:

- 3 requests per 3 minutes per unique `userIdentifier`
- 3 retries max per code, after which point that code will be locked
- 3 active codes per user, each with a 5 minute TTL
