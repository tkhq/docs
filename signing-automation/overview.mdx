Turnkey empowers teams to automate complex signing workflows at scale without compromising on security or flexibility. Transaction Automation provides the building blocks for creating custom solutions that make your product more secure, from role-based access controls to privacy-preserving smart contracts.

With Transaction Automation, you can:

- Automate millions of signatures with customizable security controls
- Implement role-based access controls and multi-party approvals
- Support any blockchain or asset type with our chain-agnostic, arbitrary signing capabilities
- Minimize attack surface area with our paranoid security model
- Easily migrate existing wallets and keys in and out of Turnkey

## Policy Engine

At the foundation of Transaction Automation is our policy engine.
Policies offer flexible controls and permissions within your organization
and enable a variety of use cases, including cross-border stablecoin payments,
treasury management, and more.

## What kind of policies can you create?

| Example                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`deployer`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/deployer/)             | Compile and deploy a smart contract                                                                                         |
| [`rebalancer`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/rebalancer/)         | A demo application which showcases an example of how to use Turnkey for managing multiple types ofÂ keys & users             |
| [`sweeper`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/sweeper/)               | Sweep funds from one address to a different address                                                                         |
| [`trading-runner`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/trading-runner/) | A sample application demonstrating a trading operation, using various private keys, users, and policies, powered by Uniswap |

Almost all actions on Turnkey are implicitly denied by default.
See our [Policy Overview](/products/transaction-automation/policy-engine) for exceptions.
