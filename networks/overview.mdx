## Multichain support at Turnkey

Turnkey is extremely flexible and supports all EVM and SVM chains, along with a vast majority of chains and assets across crypto. You don’t have to wait for us to add your preferred network.

This is because while other wallet infrastructure solutions focus on setting up support for each chain individually after they launch, Turnkey’s low-level approach focuses on supporting the underlying cryptographic curves: Secp2456k1 and Ed25519.

As a result, Turnkey is asset agnostic and can be used with any type of asset, as long as we support its corresponding curve.

## What is Turnkey's approach to supporting crypto assets?

Turnkey follows a tiered approach to supporting digital assets, ranging from supporting cryptographic curve support, to advanced transaction parsing and policy management. Each tier deepens the level of functionality, as outlined below:

**Tier 1: Curve-level support**

Cryptographic curves are our fundamental primitive, allowing Turnkey private keys to store and sign for any cryptocurrency that uses a supported curve. We currently support SECP256k1 and Ed25519 curves.

**Tier 2: Address derivation**

Turnkey abstracts address generation, automatically deriving addresses for supported cryptocurrencies.

For a full list of address formats you can derive on Turnkey, refer to [Address formats and Curves](/concepts/wallets).

**Tier 3: SDK for transaction construction and signing**

Our SDK provides tools and scripts to help in constructing and signing basic transactions, enabling an even smoother integration.

**Tier 4: Transaction parsing and policy creation**

At our highest level of support, Turnkey offers the ability to parse transactions and define custom policies based on transaction parameters.
