## Multichain support at Turnkey

Turnkey is extremely flexible and supports all EVM and SVM chains, along with a vast majority of chains and assets across crypto. You don’t have to wait for us to add your preferred network.

This is because while other wallet infrastructure solutions focus on setting up support for each chain individually after they launch, Turnkey’s low-level approach focuses on supporting the underlying cryptographic curves: Secp2456k1 and Ed25519.

As a result, Turnkey is asset agnostic and can be used with any type of asset, as long as we support its corresponding curve.
