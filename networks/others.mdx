**Can't find your preferred network?**  
Turnkey is chain-agnostic, and our flexible infrastructure is built to
support underlying cryptographic curves, instead of specific chains and assets. If your chain isn’t mentioned, check if the underlying curve is compatible – we support signing for all chains and assets on the **Ed25519 and Secp256k1** curves.

This includes chains like:

- Algorand
- Avalanche
- Cardano
- Dogecoin
- Filecoin
- Hedera
- Litecoin
- Monero
- NEAR
- Polkadot
- Stellar
- Tezos
- TON (The Open Network)
- XRP
- …and more!

If you're unsure whether your chain is supported, don't hesitate to
[get in touch](https://www.turnkey.com/contact-us).

**Code example**  
Learn how to use Turnkey to interact with over 60 blockchain networks via
this [external demo](https://github.com/AdamikHQ/adamik-tutorial/tree/signer-turnkey).
Adamik's terminal-based application provides a user-friendly interface to explore the
following multichain capabilities, powered by Turnkey:

- Generating secure cryptographic keys
- Creating addresses for different networks
- Viewing account balances and token holdings
- Preparing, signing, and broadcasting transactions
- Visualizing API interactions in real time

**Want more support?**  
We are continuously evaluating and adding support for emerging assets and protocols.
If there are specific networks you'd like to see us offer deeper support for, or
if you're looking for more code examples, please let us know by contacting us at
hello@turnkey.com, on X, or on Slack.
