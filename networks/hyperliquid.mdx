## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Hyperliquid (EVM) address derivation with `ADDRESS_TYPE_ETHEREUM`. This address format is valid across all of the Hyperliquid ecosystem (HyperCore and HyperEVM).

## Transaction construction and signing

To construct and sign a Hyperliquid (EVM) transaction with Turnkey, we offer:

- [@turnkey/viem](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/viem): contains a `createAccount` method to create a Turnkey-powered [custom account](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/local) which [Viem](https://viem.sh/) can use seamlessly.
- [@turnkey/ethers](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/ethers): contains a `TurnkeySigner` which implements Ethers' `AbstractSigner` interface. See [Ethers docs](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/abstract-signer/#AbstractSigner).

## Transaction parsing, policies, and signing

Please refer to our [Ethereum network page](/networks/ethereum) for details on transaction parsing, policies, and signing, as Hyperliquid shares the same EVM architecture. However, HyperCore notably uses EIP-712 messages to perform various actions. More information on defining EIP-712 policies, see [here](../networks/ethereum.mdx#eip-712). Additionally, top-level policy details can be found [here](../concepts/policies/language.mdx).

For an example of how to construct a policy targeting such Hyperliquid-specific EIP-712 messages, see [here](../concepts/policies/examples/ethereum.mdx#allow-signing-of-eip-712-payloads-for-hyperliquid-approveagent-operations).
