Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments. Tempo is designed to be a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain with user and developer features targeting modern payment systems including first-class stablecoin support. More on [Tempo here](https://docs.tempo.xyz/).

## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Tempo address derivation with `ADDRESS_TYPE_ETHEREUM`.

## Transaction construction and signing

During Tempo's testnet period both transaction types are signable with Turnkey, though policy engine support differs:
* [Ethereum legacy transactions](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/evm-compatibility#transaction-differences) with full parsing & policy support
* Tempo transactions with only raw payload signing and limited policy support.

## Examples

We have an example repository that demonstrates how to construct and sign Tempo transactions:
- [`examples/with-tempo`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-tempo): demonstrates transaction construction and broadcast on Tempo.

Legacy Ethereum transactions on Tempo can be utilized on Turnkey with [viem](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-viem) and [ethers](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-ethers).

## Tempo Network Support

Turnkey supports:

- Tempo Mainnet (TBA)
- Tempo Testnet

## Key Features for Tempo

- **Out of the box Legacy EVM TX support**: Turnkey fully supports the legacy transaction type on Tempo
- **Native gas sponsorship**: Our example repository provides a reference implementation for building transactions with Tempo's native gas sponsorship

## Benefits of using Turnkey with Tempo

- **Secure Key Management**: Private keys are securely stored in Turnkey's infrastructure
- **Policy Controls**: Apply custom policies to authorize transactions based on criteria
- **Developer-Friendly**: Integrate with existing Tempo development workflows
- **Multi-environment Support**: Use the same code across testnet and mainnet environments
