## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Stacks address derivation with `ADDRESS_FORMAT_DOGE_MAINNET` and `ADDRESS_FORMAT_DOGE_TESTNET` address formats. Doge addresses are derived from the secp256k1 curve, which Turnkey fully supports.

## Transaction construction and signing

Turnkey supports Doge transaction signing through the core signing capabilities. 
Check out the [examples/with-doge](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-doge) respository that demonstrates how to construct, sign and broadcast a Doge P2PKH transaction on Mainnet.

### Key Features

1. Fetch UTXOs for your Dogecoin address from BlockCypher (or use manually pre-seeded UTXOs).

2. Assemble a transaction:
- Inputs: your UTXOs
- Outputs: recipient address + change (back to your address)
- A fixed fee

3. Sign each input:
- Compute the legacy hashForSignature preimage (Dogecoin P2PKH, SIGHASH_ALL)
- Send the digest to Turnkey with HASH_FUNCTION_NO_OP
- Normalize the (r, s) pair to low-S and encode in DER format
- Attach signature + pubkey as the scriptSig
- Broadcast the raw transaction hex to BlockCypher
- Poll for confirmations until the tx is mined

## Benefits of Using Turnkey with Doge

- **Secure Key Management**: Private keys never leave Turnkeyâ€™s secure infrastructure
- **Developer Friendly**: Integrate with existing Doge development workflows
- **Signing Policies**: Apply custom policies to control transaction approvals
- **Multi-address Support**: Manage multiple Doge addresses under a single organization
