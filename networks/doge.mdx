## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Doge address derivation with `ADDRESS_FORMAT_DOGE_MAINNET` and `ADDRESS_FORMAT_DOGE_TESTNET` address formats. Doge addresses are derived from the secp256k1 curve, which Turnkey fully supports.

## Transaction construction and signing

Turnkey supports Doge transaction signing through the core signing capabilities. 
Check out the [examples/with-doge](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-doge) respository that demonstrates how to construct, sign and broadcast a Doge P2PKH transaction on Testnet.

### Key Features

1. Automatically fetch UTXOs (unspent coins), select enough inputs to cover the send amount and transaction fee.
2. Build Doge testnet transaction (inputs, outputs, change).
3. Compute sighashes & sign with Turnkey.
4. Insert signatures & pubkeys into the inputs.
5. Serialize and broadcast the raw transaction via Electrs testnet demo API.
6. Poll for confirmations until the tx is mined

## Benefits of using Turnkey with Doge

- **Secure Key Management**: Private keys never leave Turnkey’s secure infrastructure
- **Developer Friendly**: Integrate with existing Doge development workflows
- **Signing Policies**: Apply custom policies to control transaction approvals
- **Multi-address Support**: Manage multiple Doge addresses under a single organization
