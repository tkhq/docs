## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Stacks address derivation with `ADDRESS_FORMAT_COMPRESSED` and `ADDRESS_FORMAT_UNCOMPRESSED` address formats. Stacks addresses are derived from the secp256k1 curve, which Turnkey fully supports.

## Transaction construction and signing

Turnkey supports Stacks transaction signing through the core signing capabilities. We have an example respository that demonstrates how to construct and sign Sui transactions:

> [examples/with-stacks:](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-stacks) A sample script that demonstrates how to sign a [Stacks](https://docs.hiro.so/stacks/stacks.js) transaction with Turnkey. Stacks uses the secp256k1 cryptographic curve for transaction signing, but there some specific data formatting that takes place for the [signing process](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-005/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md#transaction-signing-and-verifying).

## Key Features for Stacks

- **secp256k1 signing**: Turnkey fully supports secp256k1 curve used by Stacks
- **Raw Transaction Signing**: Sign any Stacks transaction format with Turnkey's flexible signing API
- **Integration Example**: Our example repository provides a reference implementation

## Benefits of Using Turnkey with Stacks

- **Secure Key Management**: Private keys never leave Turnkeyâ€™s secure infrastructure
- **Developer Friendly**: Integrate with existing Stacks development workflows
- **Signing Policies**: Apply custom policies to control transaction approvals
- **Multi-address Support**: Manage multiple Stacks addresses under a single organization
