## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Sei address derivation. Sei is part of the Cosmos ecosystem and uses the bech32 address format with the `sei` prefix. Addresses are derived using the SECP256k1 curve.

## Transaction construction and signing

Since Sei is based on the Cosmos SDK, you can leverage our Cosmos support for transaction construction and signing:

- [`@turnkey/cosmjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/cosmjs): our CosmJS integration works with Sei as well, allowing you to use a `TurnkeyDirectWallet` as a drop-in replacement.

## Example

Here's a practical example showing how to use Turnkey with Sei for a complete transaction flow:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript example.ts [expandable]
import { Turnkey } from "@turnkey/sdk-server";
import {
  SigningStargateClient,
  GasPrice,
  calculateFee,
} from "@cosmjs/stargate";
import { coins } from "@cosmjs/amino";

// Import the initializeSeiSigner function from wallet.ts
import { initializeSeiSigner } from "./wallet";

// Initialize the Turnkey client
const turnkeyClient = new Turnkey({
  apiBaseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com",
  apiPrivateKey: process.env.API_PRIVATE_KEY,
  apiPublicKey: process.env.API_PUBLIC_KEY,
  defaultOrganizationId: process.env.ORGANIZATION_ID,
});

const signer = await initializeSeiSigner(turnkeyClient);

// Connect to Sei network - use the appropriate endpoint for mainnet/testnet
const rpcEndpoint = "https://sei-rpc.polkachu.com"; // Example RPC endpoint
const client = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(
  rpcEndpoint,
  signer,
  {
    gasPrice: GasPrice.fromString("0.01usei"),
  }
);

const recipient = "sei1recipient..."; // Recipient address
const amount = coins(1000000, "usei"); // 1 SEI
const fee = calculateFee(200000, GasPrice.fromString("0.01usei"));

const result = await client.sendTokens(
  signer.address,
  recipient,
  amount,
  fee,
  "Sent via Turnkey"
);
console.log("Transaction hash:", result.transactionHash);
```

```typescript wallet.ts [expandable]
import { type TurnkeyApiClient } from "@turnkey/sdk-server";
import { TurnkeyDirectWallet } from "@turnkey/cosmjs";

// Connect to Sei and initialize signer
export async function initializeSeiSigner(turnkeyClient: TurnkeyApiClient) {
  // Create a Turnkey-powered Sei signer
  const signer = await TurnkeyDirectWallet.init({
    config: {
      client: turnkeyClient.apiClient(),
      organizationId: process.env.ORGANIZATION_ID,
      signWith: process.env.SEI_ADDRESS, // Your Sei address in Turnkey
    },
    prefix: "sei", // Using the Sei prefix
  });

  // Get the account details
  const accounts = await signer.getAccounts();
  const account = accounts[0];

  console.log("Sei signer address:", account.address);
  console.log("Public key:", account.pubkey);

  return signer;
}
```

## Sei Network Support

Turnkey supports:

- Sei Mainnet (Pacific-1)
- Sei Testnet (Atlantic-2)

## Key Features for Sei

- **Cosmos SDK Compatibility**: Leverage the same tools used for Cosmos ecosystem
- **SECP256k1 Support**: Full support for Sei's cryptographic requirements
- **Flexible Signing**: Sign any Sei transaction format with Turnkey's signing API

## DApp Integration

For DApp developers looking to integrate with Sei, you can use Turnkey as a secure key management solution and combine it with:

- [Sei.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sei-js/core) - Official JavaScript library for Sei
- [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) - Popular JavaScript client library for the Cosmos ecosystem

## Benefits of Using Turnkey with Sei

- **Enhanced Security**: Private keys never leave Turnkey's secure infrastructure
- **Simplified Key Management**: No need to manage private keys in your application
- **Policy Control**: Apply transaction policies to control what can be signed
- **Multi-environment Support**: Use the same code across testnet and mainnet
