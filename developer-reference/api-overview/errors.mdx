```bash
Turnkey error 3: organization mismatch: request is targeting organization ("USER SUB ORG"), but voters are in organization ("OUR MAIN ORG")
```

Within this error message there are a few different parts that are worth breaking down. First the GRPC Error code. This looks like this:

```bash
Turnkey error 3:
```

This GRPC error wraps what we call a Turnkey Error which looks something like:

```bash
organization mismatch: request is targeting organization ("USER SUB ORG"), but voters are in organization ("OUR MAIN ORG")
```

What is more important to you as a developer is the TurnkeyError. This will give you information about what error occured and how you can handle it. In fact, you should **not** perform error handling based on the GRPC code. These codes are meant to be used internally and will eventually be removed from our error responses. More on that [here](#grpc-error-codes). This page enumerates all errors that might be received while using the Turnkey API and also provides information about causes for these errors and helpful troubleshooting tips.

## All Error Codes for Actions

The below table enumerates all errors across different actions that can be taken using the API. It contains both the GRPC codes as well as the HTTP codes corresponding with each error as well as the displayed error message. More on GRPC error codes below this table.

## GRPC Error Codes

Turnkey uses GRPC internally to communicate with our internal services whenever an API request is made. Due to this some errors will be wrapped with GRPC error messages. These error codes are listed below for your convenience, however these will not remain in Turnkey error messages forever and you should **not** do error handling based on these codes as these could be removed at any time. In the following example `Turnkey error 3:` represents a grpc error (error code 3, INVALID_ARGUMENT) wrapping a Turnkey error.

Example

```bash
Turnkey error 3: organization mismatch: request is targeting organization ("USER SUB ORG"), but voters are in organization ("OUR MAIN ORG")
```

| UNKNOWN             | 2      | Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when a `Status` value received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| INVALID_ARGUMENT    | 3      | The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed file name).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DEADLINE_EXCEEDED   | 4      | The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| NOT_FOUND           | 5      | Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist, `NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within a class of users, such as user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED` must be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| FAILED_PRECONDITION | 9      | The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. |
| ABORTED             | 10     | The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| OUT_OF_RANGE        | 11     | The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range \[0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Troubleshooting

### no organization found with the given ID

Common causes:

- An unknown organization ID was passed in a request made to the Turnkey API

Troubleshooting tips:

- Confirm that you are using the proper Organization ID. All Turnkey resources are identified with a UUID, so confirm you are not passing a different resource's UUID as the organization ID in your request.

### malformed organization ID provided

Common causes:

- An improperly formatted organization ID UUID was passed in a request made to the Turnkey API

Troubleshooting tips:

- Confirm the the UUID conforms to the UUID standard `XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`

### bad request body

Common causes:

- A malformed request body was passed in a request made to the Turnky API

Troubleshooting tips:

- A typical activity request has the `type`, `timestampMS`, and `organizationId` parameters at the top level and then a `parameters` parameter with more specific parameters based on the request type. For example a CREATE_WALLET activity request body might look something like this:

```json
{
  "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_WALLET",
  "timestampMs": "<string>",
  "organizationId": "string",
  "parameters": {
    "walletName": "string",
    "accounts": [
      {
        "curve": "CURVE_SECP256K1",
        "pathFormat": "PATH_FORMAT_BIP32",
        "path": "string",
        "addressFormat": "ADDRESS_FORMAT_UNCOMPRESSED"
      }
    ],
    "mnemonicLength": 0
  }
}
```

- A get resource request body might look slightly different with less fields. An example of a GET_WALLET request body looks something like this:

```json
{
  "organizationId": "string",
  "walletId": "string"
}
```

### api operations disabled

Common causes:

- Turnkey has disabled API operations globally.

Troubleshooting tips:

- This situation will only happen in the most extreme case and should not be something you need to worry about.
