This documentation contains guides for using the [Turnkey Flutter / Dart SDK](https://github.com/tkhq/dart-sdk).

We have created a set of Dart packages that can be used to interact with the Turnkey API. These can be combined to create a fully-featured Flutter app, powered by Turnkey.

## Packages

| Package Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | Link                                                                                        |

| turnkey_crypto                  | This package consolidates common cryptographic utilities used across our applications, particularly primitives related to keys, encryption, and decryption in a pure Dart implementation. | [turnkey_crypto](https://pub.dev/packages/turnkey_crypto)                                   |
| turnkey_api_key_stamper         | A Dart package for API stamping functionalities.

You can visit [Turnkey's pub.dev publisher page](https://pub.dev/publishers/turnkey.com/packages) to see all all the packages we have published and install them in your Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to build a Flutter app with Turnkey is to use our [Flutter demo app](https://github.com/tkhq/dart-sdk/tree/main/examples/flutter-demo-app) as a starter.
This app is a fully-featured example that demonstrates how to use the Turnkey's Flutter SDK to authenticate users, create wallets, export wallets, sign messages, and more.

The app includes a backend [JavaScript server](https://github.com/tkhq/dart-sdk/tree/main/examples/flutter-demo-app/api-server) which uses [@turnkey/sdk-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-server) to make requests to Turnkey that must be signed by the parent organization.
An example of a request that must be signed by the parent organization is creating a sub-organization. [(code reference)](https://github.com/tkhq/dart-sdk/blob/51405520d721910961fa942ddc5f5a3030783b9b/examples/flutter-demo-app/api-server/src/controllers/turnkey-api.ts#L139-L178)

Some requests made to Turnkey must be signed by the sub-organization. These are written in Dart and are ran by the app directly. You can find these requests in the app's [TurnkeyProvider](https://github.com/tkhq/dart-sdk/blob/main/examples/flutter-demo-app/lib/providers/turnkey.dart).
