# Examples

Turnkey infrastructure is flexible by default. We intentionally prioritize low-level primitives in our product to avoid creating blockers for developers building new kinds of applications on Turnkey.

That said, we have built out several example services and applications to help illustrate the types of functionality that Turnkey can enable.

## Code Examples

## Demos built with Turnkey

### Demo Consumer Wallet ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-consumer-wallet))

A minimal consumer wallet app powered by Turnkey. Behind the scenes, it uses [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/ethers) for signing and WalletConnect (v1) for accessing dapps.

See https://github.com/tkhq/demo-consumer-wallet for the code.

### Demo Passkey Wallet ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-passkey-wallet), [live link](https://wallet.tx.xyz))

A wallet application showing how users can register and authenticate using passkeys.
This demo uses the Turnkey API to create a new [Turnkey Sub-Organization](./Sub-Organizations.md) for each user, create a testnet Ethereum address and send a transaction on Sepolia (ETH testnet).

See https://wallet.tx.xyz (and https://github.com/tkhq/demo-passkey-wallet for the code).

### Demo Ethers Passkeys ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-ethers-passkeys))

A simple application demonstrating how to create sub-organizations, create private keys, and sign with the [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/ethers) signer, using passkeys.

<img src="/ethers-ui-screenshot.png" alt="homepage screenshot" width="800px"/>

See https://github.com/tkhq/demo-ethers-passkeys for the code.

### Demo Viem Passkeys ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-viem-passkeys))

A similar, simple application demonstrating how to create sub-organizations, create private keys, and sign with the [`@turnkey/viem`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/viem) signer, using passkeys.
