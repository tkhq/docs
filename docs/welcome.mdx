Welcome to Turnkey! To make the most out of Turnkey's wallet infrastructure, we've compiled a list of helpful resources for you below.
:::

## About

[Turnkey](https://turnkey.com) is highly flexible key management infrastructure,
purpose-built for security and scale. Our API and open-source SDKs make it easy for you to take your
product from 0 to 1, and enable developers to create millions of embedded wallets and automate complex onchain transactions.

Whether you're building a DeFi platform, a payments app, an AI agent, or anything requiring a private key,
Turnkey offers the building blocks to bring your ideas to life.

Our solution covers two main use cases:

## Concepts Overview

:::note

Before getting started, we highly recommend
familiarizing yourself with Turnkey's core concepts below to ensure a smooth implementation.

:::

---

At the core of Turnkey is an important concept:
instead of directly managing private keys, wallets
are accessed through authenticators like passkeys, social logins,
or API keys:

<p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/img/diagrams/org-diagram.png"
    alt="Concepts Overview"
    style={{ width: 700, borderRadius: "4px", boxShadow: "0 2px 5px 0 #0003" }}
  />
</p>

### Here's how that works:

- **Organizations (parent orgs)** in Turnkey are top-level
  entities that contain users, wallets, and policies for a business,
  with the initial "parent organization" _typically representing an
  entire Turnkey-powered application._
- Parent organizations can create **sub-organizations (sub-orgs)**,
  which are fully segregated organizations nested under the parent organization.
  Parent orgs cannot modify the contents of a sub-org, and sub-orgs and _typically represent an end user_.
- Both parent organizations and sub-organizations contain a set of
  **resources and authenticators** that you can configure, including their own users, wallets, API keys, private keys, and policies.
- **Activities** (like signing transactions or creating users)
  are governed by **policies** created via Turnkey's policy engine,
  though root users can bypass the policy engine when meeting root quorum requirements.
- **Wallets** in Turnkey are HD seed phrases that can generate
  multiple wallet accounts (addresses) for signing operations.

:::note

There is no set relationship between organizations, sub-organizations,
activities, wallets, and resources.
This makes Turnkey highly flexible and configurable to any use case.

### **Feature spotlight: Send crypto via a URL**

Moonshot users can now send crypto to their friends via a URL.
Under the hood, Turnkey pre-generates a wallet for the new user and
loads it with the specified amount of crypto â€” all authenticated via a biometric passkey (e.g. Face ID).

## Security

---

We take security seriously at Turnkey and have built our architecture to ensure that you and your
end users' private keys are safe. Our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.turnkey.com/) covers our
holistic security model in-depth and our vision for building verifiable key management infrastructure.

### How does Turnkey secure private keys?

Turnkey uses AWS Nitro Enclaves, a type of tamper-proof Trusted Execution Environment (TEE),
for all sensitive operations. Private keys are never decrypted outside these enclaves,
and only you can authorize key usage with your credentials. Turnkey has also implemented
stringent protocols to prevent individual engineers from altering enclave code, ensuring a secure end-to-end deployment process.

Turnkey does not store unencrypted private keys, but rather persists encrypted private key
ciphertext inside of our primary and disaster recovery databases. This ciphertext is only
to be decrypted from within the bounds of a secure enclave running verified Turnkey applications.

### Is Turnkey non-custodial? Who has access to my users' private keys?

Turnkey's novel security architecture means raw private keys themselves are never exposed to Turnkey,
your software, or your team. Specifically, Turnkey stores encrypted private keys that are only
decrypted when you authenticate to an auditable, tamper-proof secure enclave with your secret
(e.g., API key or Passkey credentials). You (and/or your end users, depending on your implementation)
remain the owner of your private keys and the funds controlled by those private keys at all times.
See [quorum deployments](https://docs.turnkey.com/security/quorum-deployments) for more details on
how we provision secure enclaves to ensure you're always in control of your private keys.

### Is Turnkey open-source?

Turnkey's infrastructure combines extensive SDK support with open-source packages that allow for straightforward
integration across multiple languages and environments. While competitors offers closed or proprietary SDKs
that lock you into limited workflows and create dependencies on specific providers,
Turnkey's open SDKs enable direct access to both lower-level abstractions and the core API, granting
you complete control over your wallet infrastructure.

We've also open-sourced [QuorumOS](https://github.com/tkhq/qos): a minimal, immutable, and deterministic
Linux unikernel build system for use cases that require high security and accountability.
QuorumOS is a critical part of Turnkey's stack for running applications inside TEEs at modern cloud scale.

Currently, we are working on a verifiable security model for our API, so that third parties can attest
to the code that is running inside of Turnkey's secure enclaves.

### How can I report a security vulnerability / Is there a bug bounty?

Turnkey highly values the security of our software, services, and systems and we actively encourage
the ethical reporting of any security vulnerabilities discovered. We invite researchers and users
to report potential security vulnerabilities to our Bug Bounty Program via
[the form in our docs,](https://docs.turnkey.com/security/reporting-a-vulnerability) or to us via email at
[security@turnkey.com](mailto:security@turnkey.com). When submitting a report via email, please provide a
thorough description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and its potential impact.

If you believe you have found very serious vulnerability, we ask that you encrypt the message to the
`security.turnkey.com` PGP key (FP: `AD6C 3E61 17A5 886E 550E F8BB 3ACD E5EA 8DC7 9275`).
