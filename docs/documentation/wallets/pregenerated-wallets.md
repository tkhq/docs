# Pre-generated wallets

Turnkey allows you to pre-generate wallets for your user before they authenticate.
This is helpful if you already know the users email or phone number, and want to
create a deposit address for them or airdrop a reward before they authenticate to Turnkey.

To accomplish this, create a new sub-org for that user with a single root user.
This root user should only have the end userâ€™s email or phone number associated with it,
and no other authenticators, which ensures that only the end user can claim the pre-generated wallet.
When the end user wants to claim the wallet, they can complete the [Email Auth](/authentication/email)
flow to authenticate and sign a transaction or add a new authenticator.
