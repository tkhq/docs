# Releases

See here for release notes by date.

## 2024-11-18

### Enable support for EIP191 signatures to sign Turnkey activities

- This allows users to use a standard wallet (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.) as a Turnkey authenticator.
- For users, disaster recovery mechanisms can now include standard wallets in addition to all previously available Turnkey authenticators.

## 2024-11-4

### Enable SMS OTP support via AWS SNS

- SMS one-time password (OTP) support is now in beta.
- Soon, you’ll be able to implement SMS verification flows into your Turnkey-powered application.

### Implement support for caching OAuth certificates from providers.

Significant latency improvements for all API and SDK flows related to [OAuth](https://docs.turnkey.com/authentication/social-logins).

## 2024-10-29

### Enhanced support for Sei, XLM, TON, DOGE

- We now support address derivations for Sei, XLM, TON, and DOGE. See [here](https://docs.turnkey.com/ecosystems/framework) for how we provide chain-level support for ecosystems.

### Updates to Solana transaction parser

- We’ve made indexing updates to our open-source [Solana transaction parser](https://github.com/tkhq/solana-parser).

### Server side error fixes, email OTP fixes

## 2024-10-01

### Introduces full support for Solana Policy Engine

- We now support writing Solana (SVM) policies in our API.
- You can use the [`sign_transaction` endpoint](https://docs.turnkey.com/api#tag/Signers/operation/SignTransaction) for all Legacy Solana and Solana Versioned transactions.
- For examples on what policies you can write, see [here](https://docs.turnkey.com/concepts/policies/examples#solana).

### Enhanced address support for Bitcoin

- Adds ability to derive multiple types of Bitcoin addresses, including Legacy addresses, Segwit, Taproot, and Schnorr signatures. This gives you the ability to generate additional private/public key pairs and their corresponding addresses on top of our initial support for Bitcoin.

### Add ability to delete sub-organizations

- You can now delete sub-organizations and corresponding wallets in Turnkey.
- This is accessible via our API or through the Turnkey dashboard.

### Improved dashboard onboarding experience

- Access Turnkey's developer platform more easily with a single email sign-on.
- Includes security hardening against account enumeration.

### [Demo Wallet](https://wallet.tx.xyz/) updates

- We've refreshed our demo wallet, and added a one-step passkey signup flow.

### Remediation of critical load balancing issue

## 2024-09-18

### Additional support for Bitcoin, Sui, and Aptos

- We now support address derivations for BTC, Sui, and Aptos.
- We've also implemented Schnorr signing to further support Bitcoin transactions.

### Add support for parsing Solana transactions

Legacy Solana transactions and Solana Versioned Transactions can now be parsed by Turnkey's Solana parser, as part of our Solana policy engine.

## 2024-09-01

### Makes email optional for `ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_READ_WRITE_SESSION`

This version of `ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_READ_WRITE_SESSION` allows users to pass in an optional userId. An email will no longer be required for this activity type.

## 2024-08-21

### Introduces support for OAuth (OIDC 2.0)

Our [OAuth](https://docs.turnkey.com/authentication/social-logins) feature is now live and out of beta. This introduces the following functionalities:

- Sign in and authentication via popular providers such as Google, Apple, and Facebook (via OpenID Connect tokens) for organizations and sub-organizations
- Custom OAuth configurations for your organizations or sub-organizations

All OIDC tokens are verified via Turnkey's secure enclaves, with a newly designed enclave to [fetch TLS content](https://quorum.tkhq.xyz/posts/tls-sessions-within-tees).

## 2024-08-15

### Add new activity type for deleting private keys and wallets

You can now delete private keys and wallets from your organization.

## 2024-08-12

### Release Turnkey wallet stamper

The [`@turnkey/wallet-stamper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/wallet-stamper) package provides a mechanism to stamp requests using a wallet public key and signature. This package supports both Solana and Ethereum wallets. A demo of how this works can be found [here](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/wallet-stamper).

## 2024-08-05

### Finalize OAuth integration to use TLS fetcher enclave

With our OAuth implementation almost complete, customers will be able to securely authenticate end users with social logins like Twitter, Google, Facebook, and more. This release ensures that TLS content can be fetched from our secure enclaves using a specialized enclave called the TLS fetcher.

### Introduces support for Ed25519 API keys

Our API now has support for the Ed25519 cryptographic curve! This improves Ed25519 compatibility in two ways:

- You can now create an API key for an existing user by using `API_KEY_CURVE_ED25519` for the `curveType` parameter. This will give users and suborganizations within your Turnkey implementation additional authenticators for transaction signing.
- You can also stamp a request using the `SIGNATURE_SCHEME_TK_API_ED25519` for the `scheme` parameter in the stamp, along with an Ed25519 signature of the json body. You will need to add a public key using the endpoint determined by creating an API key.

Stay tuned for our Ed25519 SDK! Chains on the Ed25519 cryptographic curve include Solana, TON, Polkadot, Stellar, Cardano, and Tezos.
