# Overview

## Introduction

Turnkey operates at the **cryptographic curve** level rather that specific assets. As a result Turnkey is asset
agnostic and can be used with any type of asset as long as we support the underlying curve.

We are continuously evaluating and adding support for emerging assets and protocols. If there are specific
cryptocurrencies you'd like to see us offer deeper support for, please let us know by contacting us at
[hello@turnkey.com](mailto:hello@turnkey.com), on [X](https://x.com/turnkeyhq/), or
[on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clubturnkey/shared_invite/zt-2837d2isy-gbH60kJ~XnXSSFHiqVOrqw).

## What is Turnkey's approach to supporting crypto assets?

Turnkey follows a tiered approach to supporting digital assets, ranging from supporting cryptographic curve support,
to advanced transaction parsing and policy management. Each tier deepens the level of functionality, as outlined below:

**Tier 1: Curve-level support**

Cryptographic curves are our fundamental primitive, allowing Turnkey private keys to store and sign for any
cryptocurrency that uses a supported curve. We currently support SECP256k1 and Ed25519 curves.

**Tier 2: Address derivation**

Turnkey abstracts address generation, automatically deriving addresses for supported cryptocurrencies.

For a full list of address formats you can derive on Turnkey, refer to [Address formats and Curves](/concepts/wallets).

**Tier 3: SDK for transaction construction and signing**

Our SDK provides tools and scripts to help in constructing and signing basic transactions, enabling an even smoother integration.

**Tier 4: Transaction parsing and policy creation**

At our highest level of support, Turnkey offers the ability to parse transactions and define custom policies based on transaction parameters.
