# What other ecosystems and chains does Turnkey support?

## Cosmos

We support address derivation and have published a package on NPM to help with transaction construction: [`@turnkey/cosmjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/cosmjs). See it in action in [`examples/with-cosmjs`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-cosmjs).

## Tron, Sui, Aptos, Movement

We support address derivation for these ecosystems. We also have two SDK examples:

- [`examples/with-sui`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-sui) demonstrates transaction construction and broadcast on Sui.
- [`examples/with-aptos`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-aptos) demonstrates transaction construction and broadcast on Aptos.

## Ed25519 and SECP256k1 Signing

Turnkey supports bare Ed25519 and SECP256k1 signing which covers most ecosystems and blockchains out there. If your ecosystem of choice isn't covered adequately we're open to feedback and feature requests. Give us a shout on [X](https://x.com/turnkeyhq/) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clubturnkey/shared_invite/zt-2837d2isy-gbH60kJ~XnXSSFHiqVOrqw)!
