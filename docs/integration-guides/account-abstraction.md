# Account Abstraction Wallets

Turnkey offers flexible infrastructure to create and manage keys. These keys can be used as a signer inside of an [Account Abstraction wallet](https://www.erc4337.io/), and we've partnered with [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and [ZeroDev](https://zerodev.app/) to integrate in a few lines of code.

## Alchemy's Account Kit

You can use Turnkey with Alchemy's Account Kit via the [aa-signers](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/packages/aa-signers/turnkey/introduction.html) package to generate embedded wallets, and leverage [aa-alchemy](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/packages/aa-alchemy/index.html) to create smart accounts for your users.

Visit [the Alchemy Account Kit documentation](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/smart-accounts/signers/guides/turnkey.html) for more information.

## ZeroDev Wallets

By combining Turnkey with ZeroDev you can create AA wallets with powerful functionalities such as sponsoring gas, batching transactions, and more.

Visit [the ZeroDev documentation](https://docs-v4.zerodev.app/create-wallets/integrations/turnkey) for more information.
