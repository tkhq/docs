title: "Sub-organizations"
description: "Using Turnkey's flexible infrastructure, you can programmatically create and manage sub-organizations for your end-users. Sub-organizations aren't subject to size limits: you can create as many sub-organizations as needed. The parent organization has **read-only** visibility into all of its sub-organizations, and activities performed in sub-organizations roll up to the parent for billing purposes."

We envision sub-organizations being very useful to model your end-users if you're a business using Turnkey for key management. Let's explore how.

## Creating sub-organizations

Creating a new sub-organization is an activity performed by the parent organization. The activity itself takes the following attributes as inputs:

- organization name
- a list of root users
- a root quorum threshold
- \[optional] a wallet (note: in versions prior to V4, this was a private key)

Root users can be programmatic or human, with one or many credentials attached.

## Using sub-organizations

[Sub-Organizations as Wallets](/embedded-wallets/sub-organizations-as-wallets) explains how you might want to use this primitive as a way to model end-user controlled wallets, or custodial wallets. If you have another use-case in mind, or questions/feedback on this page, reach out to [welcome@turnkey.com](mailto:welcome@turnkey.com)!

## Deleting sub-organizations

To delete a sub-organization, you can use the [delete sub-organization activity](/api-reference/organizations/delete-sub-organization).
Before proceeding, ensure that all private keys and wallets within the sub-organization have been exported to prevent any loss of funds.
Alternatively, you can set the `deleteWithoutExport` parameter to `true` to bypass this requirement.
By default, the `deleteWithoutExport` parameter is set to `false`.

<Note>
  This activity must be initiated by a root user in the sub-organization that is
  to be deleted. A parent org cannot delete a sub-organization without its
  participation.
