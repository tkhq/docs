description: "Credentials represent ways for Users to authenticate to Turnkey. All Turnkey Credentials are held by you, the end-user. Turnkey only keeps **public keys**."

At the moment, Turnkey supports 2 types of Credentials:

* Authenticators
* API Keys

Note that every Turnkey user needs at least one long-lived credential (a passkey, or non-expiring API key). This is to prevent users from getting locked out of their accounts. The exception is if the user belongs to a suborg, and [Email Auth](/authentication/email) is enabled for that sub-organization.

### Authenticators

Turnkey uses [Webauthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/) for authentication into its dashboard (no passwords!). Authenticators on Turnkey represent a Webauthn device registered on Turnkey.

When logging into Turnkey, you'll be prompted for a signature with a registered device. This signature is then verified to grant dashboard access. To avoid repeated signatures, Turnkey's dashboard uses session cookies for read traffic. However, all write actions require an authenticator signature.

### API Keys

Turnkey API requests are authenticated with API key signatures. When you generate an API key (either through our CLI or through our dashboard), you generate a P-256 key pair. Turnkey keeps the public key, and you hold the private key.

Requests made via SDK or CLI use the private API key to sign requests. Turnkey's public API expects all requests (e.g. to get data or to submit activities) to be signed.

See our [API reference](/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-keys) for how to programmatically create API keys.
