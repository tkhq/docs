title: "Delegated Access"
description: "With Turnkey you can create multi-user accounts with flexible co-ownership controls. This primitive enables you to establish delegated access to a user’s wallet, reducing or removing the need for them to manually approve each action. You can provide a smoother user experience while ensuring that end-users maintain full control over their wallets."

## Overview

Delegated access works by creating a specialized business-controlled user within each end-user’s sub-organization that has carefully scoped permissions to perform only specific actions, such as signing transactions to designated addresses. This can enable your backend to do things like: 
* Automate common transactions (e.g., staking, redemptions) 
* Sign transactions to whitelisted addresses without user involvement 
* Perform scheduled operations 
* Respond to specific onchain events programmatically 

## Implementation flow 

Here’s how to implement delegated access for an embedded wallet setup:
* Create a sub-organization with two root users: The end user and your “Delegated User” with an API key authenticator that you control 
* Enable the Delegated Account to take particular actions by setting policies explicitly allowing those specific actions
* Update the root quorum to ensure only the end-user retains root privileges

## Step-by-step implementation


### Step 1: Create a sub-organization with two root users[​](#step-1-create-a-sub-organization-with-two-root-users "Direct link to Step 1: Create a sub-organization with two root users")

* Create your sub-organization with the two root users being:

  * The end-user
  * A user you control (we'll call it the ‘Delegated Account’)

```json
{
  "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION_V7",
  "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
  "organizationId": "your-organization-id",
  "parameters": {
    "subOrganizationName": "<sub-org-name>",
    "rootUsers": [
      {
        "userName": "<end-user-name>",
        "userEmail": "enduser@example.com",
        "authenticators": [
          {
            "authenticatorName": "<passkey-name>",
            "challenge": "<webauthn-challenge>",
            "attestation": {
              "credentialId": "<credential-id>",
              "clientDataJson": "<client-data-json>",
              "attestationObject": "<attestation-object>",
              "transports": ["AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_HYBRID"]
            }
          }
        ],
        "apiKeys": [],
      "oidcProviders": []
      },
      {
        "userName": "Delegated Account",
        "userEmail": "<email>(optional)",
        "authenticators": [],
        "apiKeys": [
          {
            "apiKeyName": "<delegated-account-api-key-name>",
            "publicKey": "<delegated-account-api-public-key>"
          }
        ],
      "oidcProviders": []
      }
    ],
    "rootQuorumThreshold": 1,
    "wallet": {
      "walletName": "Default ETH Wallet",
      "accounts": [
        {
          "curve": "CURVE_SECP256K1",
          "pathFormat": "PATH_FORMAT_BIP32",
          "path": "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0",
          "addressFormat": "ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Limit the permissions of the Delegated Account user via policies

* Create a custom policy granting the Delegated Account specific permissions. You might grant that user permissions to:

  * Sign any transaction
  * Sign only transactions to a specific address
  * Create new users in the sub-org
  * Or any other activity you want to be able to take using your Delegated Account

Here’s one example, granting the Delegated Account only the permission to sign ethereum transactions to a specific receiver address:

```json
{
  "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_POLICY",
  "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
  "organizationId": "sub-organization-id",
  "parameters": {
    "policyName": "Allow Delegated Account to sign transactions to specific address",
    "policy": {
      "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
      "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.id == <DELEGATED_ACCOUNT_USER_ID>)",
      "condition": "eth.tx.to == <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>"
    },
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Remove the Delegated Account from the root quorum using the Delegated Account's credentials:

```json
{
  "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_UPDATE_ROOT_QUORUM",
  "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
  "organizationId": "<sub-organization-id>",
  "parameters": {
    "threshold": 1,
    "userIds": [
      "<end-user-id>" // Update the root quorum of the sub organization to ONLY include the end user, removing the delegated access user
    ]
  }
}'
```

After completing these steps, the sub-organization will have two users: the end-user (the only root-user) and the Delegated Account user, which only has the permissions granted earlier via policies and no longer retains root user privileges.
