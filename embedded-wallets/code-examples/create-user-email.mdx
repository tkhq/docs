<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize Turnkey">

```JavaScript
import { Turnkey } from "@turnkey/sdk-browser";

const turnkey = new Turnkey({
  apiBaseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com",
  defaultOrganizationId: process.env.TURNKEY_ORGANIZATION_ID,
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Sub Organization for the User">

```JavaScript
import { DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS } from "@turnkey/sdk-browser;"

const subOrganizationConfig = {
  subOrganizationName: <subOrganizationName>,
  rootUsers: [{
    userName: <userEmail>,
    userEmail: <userEmail>,
    apiKeys: [],
    authenticators: [],
    oauthProviders: []
  }],
  rootQuorumThreshold: 1,
  wallet: {
    walletName: <walletName>,
    accounts: DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS
  }
};
```
</Step>

<Step title="Call createSubOrganization from your backend">

```JavaScript
await turnkey.serverSign("createSubOrganization", [subOrganizationConfig]);
```

This is all that is needed to create a user without any authentication credential other than their email address, in the [login](/embedded-wallets/code-examples/authenticate-user-email) flow you can see how to then authenticate the user after their `subOrganization` is created.
