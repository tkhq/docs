This page walks you through the React flow with full code examples. For using `@turnkey/core` directly, see [Sending Sponsored Transactions](/signing-automation/code-examples/sending-sponsored-transactions).

<SendTxGasUsage />

For additional references leveraging these endpoints, check out our [Swapping Example](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/eth-usdc-swap) and [Sweeping Example](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/sweeper)

## EVM Paymaster Example

You may also leverage our own example for setting up EVM paymaster leveraging the above endpoints. This example shows how to send an erc-20 token on EVM networks using Turnkey's paymaster (gas sponsorship).

Please refer to [with-paymaster](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-paymaster) to see how to setup and manage paymaster for your transaction operations.
