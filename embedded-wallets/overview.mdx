## Overview

With Embedded Wallets, you can create custom wallet experiences that are seamlessly integrated into your product, without compromising on security. Whether you need custodial or non-custodial wallets, our infrastructure provides the foundation for building innovative, user-friendly crypto products.

## Why Embedded Wallets?

Embedded Wallets give you the freedom to design and control the entire user experience, while offloading the complexity and risk of private key management to Turnkey.

With Embedded Wallets, you can:

- Leverage pre-built UI components to speed up your integration
- Easily create a variety of wallets for your users
- Authenticate users via email, phone number, biometrics, social logins, etc
- Determine delegated access and co-owernership controls
- Access out-of-the-box support for multiple chains and assets
- Sign multiple transactions without additional approvals
- Access simple integrations for gas sponsorship and smart contract wallets

### Custodial vs non-custodial

Turnkey's Embedded Wallets are built on top of Sub-Organizations.
Each wallet is represented by a sub-organization, which can be configured with different security settings and access controls.

- For custodial wallets, your application holds the master key and can initiate transactions on behalf of users.
- For non-custodial wallets, users hold their own private keys and must approve each transaction,
  whether it's via their own passkey, API key, or iframe session.

Below, we'll dive into how we set each of these up but first, let's make sure you're familiar with
the Embedded Wallets concepts and architecture.

### Integrating Embedded Wallets

#### Overview

Now that you've gotten started, this guide walks through 3 ways to use **sub-organizations** as
Embedded Wallets for your **users**. We first show that it can be used to create **non-custodial wallets**,
or end-user controlled wallets. Then we explain how you can create **custodial wallets,** and lastly shared custody wallets.

#### Non-Custodial Wallets

Sub-Organizations as end-user controlled wallets  
Before you start  
Step 1: Create a sub-organization  
Step 2: Wallet creation  
Step 3: Transaction signing

- User authentication with passkeys, email auth, and OAuth
- Creating new wallets and wallet accounts
- Sending and receiving funds
- Importing/Exporting a wallet
- Adding a credential to the wallet

Demo Embedded Wallet (code, live link)  
A wallet application showing how users can register and authenticate using passkeys. This demo uses the Turnkey API to create a new Turnkey Sub-Organization for each user, create a testnet Ethereum address and send a transaction on Sepolia (ETH testnet).

### SDKs

React, RN, Flutter, iOS, Typescript
