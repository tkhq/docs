With Embedded Wallets, you can create custom wallet experiences that are seamlessly integrated into your product, without compromising on security. Whether you need custodial or non-custodial wallets, our infrastructure provides the foundation for building innovative, user-friendly crypto products.

### Why Embedded Wallets?

Embedded Wallets give you the freedom to design and control the entire user experience, while offloading the complexity and risk of private key management to Turnkey.

With Embedded Wallets, you can:

- Leverage pre-built UI components to speed up your integration
- Easily create a variety of wallets for your users
- Authenticate users via email, phone number, biometrics, social logins, etc
- Determine delegated access and co-owernership controls
- Access out-of-the-box support for multiple chains and assets
- Sign multiple transactions without additional approvals
- Access simple integrations for gas sponsorship and smart contract wallets

### Custodial vs non-custodial

Turnkey's Embedded Wallets are built on top of Sub-Organizations.
Each wallet is represented by a sub-organization, which can be configured with different security settings and access controls.

- For custodial wallets, your application holds the master key and can initiate transactions on behalf of users.
- For non-custodial wallets, users hold their own private keys and must approve each transaction,
  whether it's via their own passkey, API key, or iframe session.

Below, we'll dive into how we set each of these up but first, let's make sure you're familiar with
the Embedded Wallets concepts and architecture.

### Embedded Wallets Quickstart

If you haven't yet, get started quickly using Turnkey's Account/Embedded Wallets Setup. You'll learn how to:

- Create an Account
- Get Your Organization ID
- Create an API Key
- Set up Turnkey's React SDK in a Next.js application
- Configure authentication with email sign-in
- Implement message signing functionality using a user's Turnkey wallet
- Handle user sessions and wallet interactions

Get started [here](/getting-started/embedded-wallet-quickstart) and come back when you're ready.

### Integrating Embedded Wallets

Now that you've gotten started, this guide walks through 3 ways to use **sub-organizations** as
Embedded Wallets for your **users**. We first show that it can be used to create **non-custodial wallets**,
or end-user controlled wallets. Then we explain how you can create **custodial wallets,** and lastly shared custody wallets.

#### Non-Custodial Wallets

In this example wallet implementation, you will create a segregated sub-organization for each end-user, and leverage [passkeys](/authentication/passkeys/introduction) as cryptographic proof of ownership to ensure only the end-user has the ability to approve signing. Your application will construct transactions on behalf of the end-user, and then surface the relevant Turnkey activity request client-side for end-user approval.

Note that Turnkey is not a customer authentication platform. This gives you the flexibility to create the user experience you envision. Typically, Turnkey integrators implement their own standard end-user authentication flows for login, then employ passkeys behind that login for transaction signing.

If you'd like to see a live example, head over to our [✨Demo Embedded Wallet✨](https://wallet.tx.xyz/), and follow along with the code [here](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-embedded-wallet).

**Before you start**

Make sure you've set up your primary Turnkey organization with at least one API user for programmatic user onboarding.
Check out our [Quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart) if you need help getting started.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a sub-organization" >
  After the end-user is logged in, your application prompts the user for passkey creation on the application domain. Our JavaScript SDK has a helper for this: `getWebAuthnAttestation`. See [this example](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-federated-passkeys).

  Your application then uses an API-only user to create a new sub-organization on behalf of the end-user with a `CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION` activity. In the example below, the new sub-organization has one root user controlled by the end user's passkey, and an associated Ethereum wallet:

  ```js
  {
    "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION_V4",
    "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
    "organizationId": "<your-organization-id>",
    "parameters": {
      "subOrganizationName": "<sub-org-name>",
      "rootUsers": [
        {
          "userName": "<end-user-name>",
          "userEmail": "<email>(optional)",
          "authenticators": [
            {
              "authenticatorName": "<passkey-name>",
              "challenge": "<webauthn-challenge>",
              "attestation": {
                "credentialId": "<credential-id>",
                "clientDataJson": "<client-data-json>",
                "attestationObject": "<attestation-object>",
                "transports": ["AUTHENTICATOR_TRANSPORT_HYBRID"]
              }
            }
          ],
          "apiKeys": []
        }
      ],
      "rootQuorumThreshold": 1,
      "wallet": {
        "walletName": "Default Wallet",
        "accounts": [
          {
            "curve": "CURVE_SECP256K1",
            "pathFormat": "PATH_FORMAT_BIP32",
            "path": "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0",
            "addressFormat": "ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

  The response will contain the new sub-organization ID as well as details about its associated Ethereum wallet:

  ```js
  {
    "subOrganizationId": "<your-new-sub-org>", // the organization_id that the end-user must use when signing requests
    "wallet": {
      "walletId": "<your-new-wallet>", // the wallet ID used to generate more accounts
      "addresses": "<your-new-addresses>" // the addresses you can now sign with
    }
  }
  ```

  Note: root users created with sub-organizations can have both API keys and authenticators (e.g. passkeys). In this example we only expect passkeys. See [Sub-Organizations as shared wallets](#sub-organizations-as-shared-wallets) for a use case which requires both.

  With this setup each end-user now has sole control over their sub-organization and any resources created within it. Your application cannot take any actions on resources within the sub-organization without explicit cryptographic authorization from the end-user in the form of a passkey signature.

  It's important to note that the initial activity to create a sub-organization has to be authorized by an API key of a user in your main Turnkey organization. Otherwise, anyone would be able to create sub-organizations in your organization! Here's an [example](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/a2bfbf3cbd6040902bbe4c247900ac560be42925/examples/with-federated-passkeys/src/pages/index.tsx#L88-L116) where the initial registration is done, and posted to a NextJS backend. The NextJS backend inserts the attestation and signs the `CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION_V4` activity [here](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/ba360baeb60d80276f7faeca602b99190fe5affe/examples/with-federated-passkeys/src/pages/api/createSubOrg.ts#L27-L106).

  </Step>

<Step title="Wallet creation" >

  While the **first wallet creation is already done** (our `CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION` activity accepts a `wallet` parameter!), your end-users can derive more accounts or create more wallets after the fact by using their passkeys to sign a `CREATE_WALLET` activity.

  We've abstracted getting WebAuthn signatures and creating signed Turnkey requests behind typed methods (e.g. `createWallet`).

  Our `TurnkeyClient` (from [`@turnkey/http`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/http)) can be initialized with a `WebauthnStamper` (from [`@turnkey/webauthn-stamper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/webauthn-stamper)):

  ```js
  import { WebauthnStamper } from "@turnkey/webauthn-stamper";
  import { TurnkeyClient } from "@turnkey/http";

  const stamper = new WebAuthnStamper({
  rpId: "your-domain.com",
    });

    // New HTTP client able to sign with passkeys!
    const httpClient = new TurnkeyClient(
      { baseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com" },
      stamper
    );

    // Signs and sends a request to Turnkey
    await httpClient.createWallet({
      type: "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_WALLET",
      organizationId: "<user sub-organization>",
      timestampMs: String(Date.now()),
      parameters: {
        walletName: "New Wallet",
        accounts: [
          {
            curve: "CURVE_SECP256K1",
            pathFormat: "PATH_FORMAT_BIP32",
            path: "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0",
            addressFormat: "ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM",
          },
        ],
      },
    });
    ```

    In the snippet above we send the activity directly to Turnkey's backend. Our SDK also comes with abstractions to create a `signedRequest`, which contain all the components needed to forward it to Turnkey: URL, body, and a stamp header (with name and value properties). Use `httpClient.stampCreateWallet` to get a signed request. Your backend server can then proxy it to Turnkey.

    Next, we can derive additional accounts (addresses) given a single HD wallet. The shape of the request is as follows:

    ```js
      {
        "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_WALLET_ACCOUNTS",
        "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
        "organizationId": "<your-organization-id>",
        "parameters": {
          "walletId": "<your-wallet-id>",
          "accounts": [
            {
              "curve": "CURVE_SECP256K1",
              "pathFormat": "PATH_FORMAT_BIP32",
              "path": "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0",
              "addressFormat": "ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Transaction signing" >

    The end-user must provide a signature over each `SIGN_TRANSACTION` activity with their passkey. In your application, a user action (for example tapping a "Withdraw Rewards" button) might trigger the flow. The details of this transaction should be presented to the user for confirmation, followed by a passkey prompt to sign the Turnkey activity. An activity to sign a transaction looks like the following:

      "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
      "organizationId": "<sub-organization-id>",
      "parameters": {
        "signWith": "<wallet account address, private key id, or private key address>",
        "type": "TRANSACTION_TYPE_ETHEREUM",
        "unsignedTransaction": "<unsigned-transaction>"
      }
    }
    ```

    Turnkey returns a signed transaction in the activity result which your application can broadcast using any provider you'd like.

  </Step>

</Steps>

#### Custodial Wallets


Most of the steps outlined in the previous section remain unchanged: applications creating custodial wallets should still create segregated sub-organizations for their end-users to avoid limits (we currently have a maximum of 100 users per organization, whereas an organization can have unlimited sub-organizations).

The main difference is in the Root Quorum settings: upon creating a new sub-organization, your business's API key is used to bootstrap each end-user organization. The `CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION_V4` activity becomes:

```json
{
  "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_SUB_ORGANIZATION_V4",
  "timestampMs": "<time-in-ms>",
  "organizationId": "<your-organization-id>",
  "parameters": {
    "subOrganizationName": "<sub-org-name>",
    "rootUsers": [{
      "userName": "<your-business-user>",
      "userEmail": "<email>(optional)",
      "authenticators": [],
      "apiKeys": [
        "apiKeyName": "<api-key-name>",
        "publicKey": "<your-business-api-public-key>"
      ],
    }],
    "rootQuorumThreshold": 1,
    "wallet": {
      "walletName": "Default ETH Wallet",
      "accounts": [
        {
          "curve": "CURVE_SECP256K1",
          "pathFormat": "PATH_FORMAT_BIP32",
          "path": "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0",
          "addressFormat": "ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM",
        },
      ],
    },
  }
}
```

(Note the empty `"authenticators"` list!)

Key creation and signatures can also be performed with this root API user, and the end-user doesn't need to be involved in the activity signing process.

Policies can be use to segregate permissions if needed: you could, for example, bootstrap each sub-org with 2 API users: one to create keys and setup the organization policies; the other to sign transactions.

#### Shared Wallets

For the sake of completeness: it is possible to create "shared custody" wallets with the sub-organization primitive. To do this, an application would setup sub-organizations with the following settings:

* Root quorum threshold: 2

* Root users:

  * 1 user representing the end-user (with their Passkey as an authenticator)
  * 1 user representing the business (with an API key attached)

The signing process would then have to involve **both** the user and the business 
since the root quorum threshold is 2. To reduce friction for the end-user, 
many clients opt to start with a root quorum of 1. This way, you can take 
certain actions with your business's API key root user **prior** to updating 
the root quorum threshold to 2.
