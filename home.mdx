# Concepts

Before getting started, we highly recommend familiarizing yourself with Turnkey's core concepts to ensure a smooth implementation. At the core of Turnkey is an important concept: instead of directly managing private keys, wallets are accessed through authenticators like passkeys, social logins, or API keys.

#### Here's how that works:

- **Organizations (parent orgs)**: The initial parent organization typically represents an entire Turnkey-powered application.
- **Sub-Organizations (sub-orgs)**: Fully segregated organizations, typically representing an end user, nested under the parent organization. Parent orgs cannot modify the contents of a sub-org.
- **Resources**: All identifiers within parent orgs such as users, policies, and wallets are collectively referred to as resources.
- **Users**: Resources within organizations or sub-organizations that can submit activities to Turnkey via a valid credential.
- **Authenticators**: Each parent org, sub-org and user contain their own sets of authenticators that you can configure, including their own wallets, API keys, and private keys.
- **Activities**: All actions Organizations can take such as signing transactions or creating users are known as activities.
- **Policies**: Policies govern all activities and permissions within Organizations.
- **Root Users**: Users with root permissions, meaning they can bypass the policy engine to take any action within that specific organization.
- **Root Quorum**: A pre-determined consensus threshold that consists of a set of Root Users. This consensus threshold must be reached in order for any root permissions to take place.
- **Wallets**: A collection of cryptographic private/public key pairs that share a common seed. HD seed phrases can generate multiple wallet accounts (addresses) for signing operations.

There is no set relationship between organizations, sub-organizations, activities, wallets, and resources.
This makes Turnkey highly flexible and configurable to any use case.

# SDKs

Turnkey provides a variety of client libraries for building with Embedded Wallets, Transaction Automation,
and other common workflows. We also have several wrappers for popular web3 libraries for easy integration
into existing dApps. We recommend reviewing our concepts, account setup and solution pages before moving
forward with our SDKs.

### AI-Ready Docs

Turnkey documentation is fully integrated with AI tooling. Whether you're chatting with GPT, coding with Cursor,
or building your own LLM assistant, our docs are structured for direct ingestion and deep contextâ€”plus,
search and chat with specific pages right from your IDE or browser. Explore the [docs](/developer-reference/using-llms).

# Security

Turnkey is the first verifiable key management system of its kind, securing millions of wallets and private keys
for a wide variety of use cases. Turnkey's security architecture ensures that raw private keys are never exposed
to Turnkey, your software, or your team. We provide end-to-end private key generation and access control within
secure enclaves. Our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.turnkey.com/) covers our holistic security model in-depth,
and speaks to our vision for building verifiable key management infrastructure. Learn more about our approach to
security [here](/security/our-approach).

# Account Setup

Before diving into the code, let's set up your organization and spin up an API keypair to unlock the full
potential of Turnkey! Get started [here](/getting-started/quickstart).
