# Concepts

Before getting started, we highly recommend familiarizing yourself with Turnkey’s core concepts to ensure a smooth implementation. At the core of Turnkey is an important concept: instead of directly managing private keys, wallets are accessed through authenticators like passkeys, social logins, or API keys.

#### Here’s how that works:

- Organizations (parent orgs): The initial **parent organization** typically represents an entire Turnkey-powered application.
- Sub-Organizations (sub-orgs): Fully segregated organizations, typically representing an end user, nested under the **parent organization**. **Parent orgs** cannot modify the contents of a **sub-org**.
- Resources: All identifiers within **parent orgs** such as **users**, **policies**, and **wallets** are collectively referred to as resources.
- Users: **Resources** within organizations or **sub-organizations** that can submit **activities** to Turnkey via a valid credential.
- Authenticators: Each **parent org**, **sub-org** and **user** contain their own sets of **authenticators** that you can configure, including their own **wallets**, API keys, and private keys.
- Activities: All actions Organizations can take such as signing transactions or creating **users** are known as **activities**.
- Policies: Policies govern all **activities** and permissions within Organizations.
- Root Users: Users with root permissions, meaning they can bypass the policy engine to take any action within that specific organization.
- Root Quorum: A pre-determined consensus threshold that consists of a set of **Root Users**. This consensus threshold must be reached in order for any root permissions to take place.
- Wallets: A collection of cryptographic private/public key pairs that share a common seed. HD seed phrases can generate multiple wallet accounts (addresses) for signing operations.

There is no set relationship between organizations, sub-organizations, activities, wallets, and resources.
This makes Turnkey highly flexible and configurable to any use case.

#### AI-Ready Docs

Turnkey documentation is fully integrated with AI tooling. Whether you're chatting with GPT, coding with Cursor,
or building your own LLM assistant, our docs are structured for direct ingestion and deep context—plus,
search and chat with specific pages right from your IDE or browser. Explore the docs.

# Security

Turnkey is the first verifiable key management system of its kind, securing millions of wallets and private keys
for a wide variety of use cases. Turnkey's security architecture ensures that raw private keys are never exposed
to Turnkey, your software, or your team. We provide end-to-end private key generation and access control within
secure enclaves. Our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.turnkey.com/) covers our holistic security model in-depth,
and speaks to our vision for building verifiable key management infrastructure. Learn more about our approach to
security here.

{/* Ensure the text content of this heading below ↓ "Here's how..." matches the href in styles.css to keep it hidden in the table of contents */}

### Here's how that works:

- **Organizations (parent orgs)** in Turnkey are top-level entities that contain users, wallets, and policies for a business, with the initial "parent organization" _typically representing an entire Turnkey-powered application._
- Parent organizations can create **sub-organizations (sub-orgs)**, which are fully segregated organizations nested under the parent organization. Parent orgs cannot modify the contents of a sub-org, and sub-orgs and _typically represent an end user_.
- Both parent organizations and sub-organizations contain a set of **resources and authenticators** that you can configure, including their own users, wallets, API keys, private keys, and policies.
- **Activities** (like signing transactions or creating users) are governed by **policies** created via Turnkey's policy engine, though root users can bypass the policy engine when meeting root quorum requirements.
- **Wallets** in Turnkey are HD seed phrases that can generate multiple wallet accounts (addresses) for signing operations.

<Info>
  There is no set relationship between organizations, sub-organizations,
  activities, wallets, and resources. This makes Turnkey highly flexible and
  configurable to any use case.

## Security

We take security seriously at Turnkey and have built our architecture to ensure that you and your end users' private keys are safe. Our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.turnkey.com/) covers our holistic security model in-depth and our vision for building verifiable key management infrastructure.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How does Turnkey secure private keys?">

Turnkey uses AWS Nitro Enclaves, a type of tamper-proof Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), for all sensitive operations. Private keys are never decrypted outside these enclaves, and only you can authorize key usage with your credentials. Turnkey has also implemented stringent protocols to prevent individual engineers from altering enclave code, ensuring a secure end-to-end deployment process.

Turnkey does not store unencrypted private keys, but rather persists encrypted private key ciphertext inside of our primary and disaster recovery databases. This ciphertext is only to be decrypted from within the bounds of a secure enclave running verified Turnkey applications.

<Accordion title="Is Turnkey non-custodial? Who has access to my users' private keys?">

Turnkey's novel security architecture means raw private keys themselves are never exposed to Turnkey, your software, or your team. Specifically, Turnkey stores encrypted private keys that are only decrypted when you authenticate to an auditable, tamper-proof secure enclave with your secret (e.g., API key or Passkey credentials). You (and/or your end users, depending on your implementation) remain the owner of your private keys and the funds controlled by those private keys at all times. See [quorum deployments](/security/quorum-deployments) for more details on how we provision secure enclaves to ensure you're always in control of your private keys.

<Accordion title="Is Turnkey open-source?">

Turnkey's infrastructure combines extensive SDK support with open-source packages that allow for straightforward integration across multiple languages and environments. While competitors offers closed or proprietary SDKs that lock you into limited workflows and create dependencies on specific providers, Turnkey's open SDKs enable direct access to both lower-level abstractions and the core API, granting you complete control over your wallet infrastructure.

We've also open-sourced [QuorumOS](https://github.com/tkhq/qos): a minimal, immutable, and deterministic Linux unikernel build system for use cases that require high security and accountability. QuorumOS is a critical part of Turnkey's stack for running applications inside TEEs at modern cloud scale.

Currently, we are working on a verifiable security model for our API, so that third parties can attest to the code that is running inside of Turnkey's secure enclaves.

<Accordion title="How can I report a security vulnerability / Is there a bug bounty?">

Turnkey highly values the security of our software, services, and systems and we actively encourage the ethical reporting of any security vulnerabilities discovered. We invite researchers and users to report potential security vulnerabilities to our Bug Bounty Program via [the form in our docs,](/security/reporting-a-vulnerability) or to us via email at [security@turnkey.com](mailto:security@turnkey.com). When submitting a report via email, please provide a thorough description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and its potential impact.

If you believe you have found very serious vulnerability, we ask that you encrypt the message to the `security.turnkey.com` PGP key (FP: `AD6C 3E61 17A5 886E 550E F8BB 3ACD E5EA 8DC7 9275`). This can also be found on Turnkey's website at `https://www.turnkey.com/.well-known/security.asc`
