## Key Management Examples

These guides demonstrate common key management patterns using Turnkey's secure enclave infrastructure.

## Available examples

| Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Disaster Recovery](/products/key-management/examples/disaster-recovery) | Recover wallets and cryptographic material when security incidents occur, credentials are compromised, or infrastructure failures threaten access |
| [Encryption Key Escrow](/products/key-management/examples/encryption-key-escrow) | Use Turnkey as a secure key storage and retrieval service with a 2-of-2 security model |

## Disaster Recovery

Secure, auditable recovery paths for wallets and cryptographic material. Covers two recovery architectures:

- **Direct Wallet Import**: Import keys directly into Turnkey's secure enclave for immediate operational recovery
- **Encryption Key Escrow**: Store only encryption keys in Turnkey while keeping encrypted bundles in your infrastructure

Best for: Treasury backup, provider migration, enterprise disaster recovery procedures.

## Encryption Key Escrow

Use Turnkey as a secure key storage and retrieval service rather than relying on Turnkey for signing operations directly. This pattern separates encrypted data (in your infrastructure) from encryption keys (in Turnkey's secure enclave).

Best for: User-controlled backup and recovery, compliance separation, non-custodial products, distributed trust models.
