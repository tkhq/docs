Turnkey provides enterprise-grade key management infrastructure built on [secure enclaves](/security/secure-enclaves). Store, recover, and manage cryptographic keys with programmable access controls, quorum approvals, and end-to-end encryption.

With Key Management, you can:

- Securely store private keys in hardware-backed secure enclaves
- Import existing keys from other providers or cold storage
- Export keys with policy controls and quorum approval
- Implement disaster recovery procedures with cryptographic guarantees
- Distribute trust using encryption key escrow patterns

## Secure Enclaves

At the foundation of Key Management is Turnkey's [secure enclave infrastructure](/security/secure-enclaves). Keys are generated and stored inside hardware-backed enclaves, and key material never exists in plaintext outside the enclave boundary.

## What can you build?

| Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Disaster Recovery](/products/key-management/examples/disaster-recovery) | Recover wallets and cryptographic material when incidents occur or credentials are compromised |
| [Encryption Key Escrow](/products/key-management/examples/encryption-key-escrow) | Use Turnkey as a secure key storage service with a 2-of-2 security model |

## Other use cases

### Treasury backup

Enterprise teams can use Turnkey to establish secure backup procedures for treasury keys:

- Import keys with end-to-end encryption to the enclave
- Configure quorum policies for recovery operations
- Maintain cryptographic audit trails for compliance

### Provider migration

Migrate keys from another custody provider into Turnkey's secure enclaves with zero plaintext exposure during transit.
