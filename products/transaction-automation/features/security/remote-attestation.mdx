# Remote Attestation

Remote attestation enables an enclave to cryptographically prove its identity and integrity to a remote verifier. Key points:

- Enclaves generate a signed quote containing measurements (hashes) of their code and configuration.
- Only quotes signed by a hardware root of trust (e.g., AWS Nitro Security Module) are considered valid.
- The verifier checks the quote against expected measurements to ensure no unauthorized modifications.
- Attestation workflows typically follow:
  1. Host application sends an attestation request to the enclave.
  2. Enclave performs measurement, signs the quote, and returns it.
  3. Host or external verifier validates the signature and measurements.

This process establishes trust before any sensitive data or operations are performed within the enclave.
