# Overview

QuorumOS is Turnkeyâ€™s minimal, immutable Linux unikernel designed for high-security enclaves. It provides:

- A deterministic build system ensuring reproducible, auditable artifacts.
- A small trusted computing base, reducing attack surface.
- An initialization and attestation framework that verifies only authorized code runs within the enclave.
- Integration with hardware root-of-trust modules (e.g., AWS Nitro Security Module) to establish secure execution environments.
