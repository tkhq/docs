# Embedded Business Wallets

Business embedded wallets: custody model, approval workflows, access controls, and operational architecture. Turnkey provides secure key infrastructure in TEEs while you control roles, policies, automation, and spending guardrails.

## Why business embedded wallets?

Embedded business wallets let organizations manage treasury, payroll, vendor payments, and internal spending without handling private keys directly.

Turnkey runs the wallet infrastructure inside hardware-backed [Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)](/security/our-approach). Keys never leave the enclave. All signing is policy-controlled and verifiable.

Unlike consumer wallets, business wallets typically require:

- Multi-user access
- Approval workflows
- Spending limits and budgets
- Recipient allowlists
- Backend automation
- Auditability and control

Turnkey’s policy engine lets you define who can sign, what they can sign, how many approvals are required, and under what conditions — without deploying contracts or coordinating onchain logic.

See [Embedded Wallets Overview](/embedded-wallets/overview) for the consumer-facing counterpart.

## Key implementation decisions

For a full map of embedded wallet capabilities, see the [Features overview](/embedded-wallets/features/overview).

| Decision | Summary | Learn more |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Custody model** | Team-controlled, backend-controlled, or delegated/hybrid. Configure via policies and organizational roles. | [Policy Quickstart](/concepts/policies/quickstart), [Delegated Access](/concepts/policies/delegated-access-overview) |
| **Authentication** | Passkeys, OAuth/email, SSO, or API keys for backend services. | [Authentication Overview](/authentication/overview) |
| **Session management** | Operator sessions vs service credentials; configurable expiration and storage. | [Sessions](/authentication/sessions) |
| **Wallet architecture** | Key-based (HD) or smart contract wallets depending on treasury requirements. | [Wallets Concept](/concepts/wallets) |
| **Transaction management** | Policy-enforced approvals, spending caps, allowlists, and automation. | [Transaction Management](/concepts/transaction-management) |
| **Key portability** | Optional import/export for migration, DR, or governance controls. | [Export](/embedded-wallets/code-examples/export), [Import](/embedded-wallets/code-examples/import) |

## Custody model

Choose how control is distributed across your organization:

| Model | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Team-controlled** | Multiple users authorize actions under role or quorum rules. |
| **Backend-controlled** | Automated services sign within scoped permissions. |
| **Delegated / hybrid** | Humans and automation share scoped authority. |

Policies define exactly who can sign what, with what limits.

---

## Authentication

Business wallets often mix interactive and automated access:

- **Passkeys / OAuth / SSO:** For operators and finance teams.
- **API keys:** For backend services (sweeps, payroll, rebalancing).
- **Email-based auth:** For smaller teams or transitional setups.

Authentication binds each request to an approved identity. Signing cannot occur without a valid, policy-approved request.

See [Authentication Overview](/authentication/overview).

---

## Session management

Choose how operators and services stay authorized:

- **Operator sessions:** Read-write sessions for finance or operations teams.
- **Service credentials:** API-based authentication for backend automation.
- **Session duration:** Default 15 minutes (configurable).
- **Storage:** IndexedDB (web), SecureStorage (mobile), or LocalStorage depending on architecture.

See [Sessions](/authentication/sessions).

---

## Wallet architecture

| Approach | Pros | Considerations |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Key-based (HD wallets)** | Simple, chain-agnostic, broad compatibility. | Standard derivation and signing. |
| **Smart contract wallets** | Advanced permissions, batching, sponsorship. | Requires deployment and infrastructure. |

Turnkey supports both. See [Wallets Concept](/concepts/wallets).

---

## Transaction management

Business operations require programmable guardrails:

- Multi-approval workflows
- Spending caps (per transaction or daily)
- Role-based limits
- Recipient allowlists
- Asset restrictions (e.g., USDC-only)
- Automated recurring payments

All enforced at signing time by the policy engine.

See [Transaction Management](/concepts/transaction-management).

---

## Core capabilities

### Programmable approval requirements

Define thresholds and quorum rules.  
Small payments auto-approve. Large transfers require multiple signers.

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

Assign tags such as `finance-team`, `executive`, or `operations`.  
Policies reference those tags to grant scoped permissions.

### Recipient allowlists

Maintain approved vendor addresses.  
Transactions outside the allowlist are denied automatically.

### Automated scheduled payments

Backend services sign recurring transactions within defined limits.

### Spending limits

Enforce transaction ceilings, daily caps, and asset restrictions at the policy layer.

## Example: Treasury-style wallet

Typical requirements and how Turnkey addresses them:

| Requirement | Turnkey capability |
| :-- | :-- |
| Multi-user approvals | Quorum-based consensus rules |
| Vendor allowlists | `eth.tx.to in [...]` policies |
| Department budgets | Value ceilings scoped by user tags |
| Automated sweeps | Backend service with restricted signing scope |
| Asset controls | Restrict by token contract address |
| No key exposure | Keys remain inside secure e
