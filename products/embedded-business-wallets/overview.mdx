## Embedded Business Wallets

Manage organizational wallets with programmable controls. Define approval workflows, spending limits, and access policies. Private keys stay in hardware-backed enclaves. See [Embedded Wallets Overview](/embedded-wallets/overview) for the consumer-facing counterpart.

## Why Turnkey for Embedded Business Wallets?

Business wallets are organization-controlled wallets for internal operations: treasury, payroll, vendor payments, and operational funds. Unlike consumer wallets where each end user owns their wallet, business wallets require coordinated access across teams with configurable approval requirements.

Turnkey runs wallet infrastructure for business operations. Create wallets for your organization. Define who can sign, what they can sign, and how many approvals are required. Set spending limits and recipient allowlists. Private keys stay in hardware-backed enclaves, secured through Turnkey's [verifiable security architecture](/security/our-approach).

Use the policy engine to encode your approval workflows. No smart contract deployments. No on-chain coordination. Update rules instantly.

## Typical use cases

| Need | Turnkey solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Treasury management | Centralized funds with role-based access and multi-approval requirements |
| Payroll automation | Scheduled payments to allowlisted recipients without manual signing |
| Vendor payments | Contact lists with pre-approved addresses and spending limits |
| Delegated spending | Grant limited payment authority to teams or individuals |
| Multi-approval workflows | Require 2+ approvers for high-value transactions |
| Spending controls | Per-transaction limits, daily caps, recipient restrictions |

## Core capabilities

**Programmable approval requirements**: Define how many approvals each transaction type needs. Small payments auto-approve. Large transfers require multiple signers. Update thresholds without code changes.

**Role-based access control**: Assign permissions via user tags. Finance team signs up to $10k. Executives required above $50k. Operators handle day-to-day transactions.

**Recipient allowlists**: Maintain approved vendor and contractor addresses. Payments to known recipients can bypass additional approval steps.

**Automated scheduled payments**: Backend services sign recurring transactions (payroll, subscriptions) based on policy rules. No manual intervention required.

**Spending limits**: Enforce per-transaction maximums, daily outflow caps, and asset restrictions at the policy level.

## Policy examples

### Role-based signing limits

```json
{
  "policyName": "Finance team can sign transactions up to $10,000",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('finance-team'))",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value <= 10000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Multi-approval for high-value transactions

```json
{
  "policyName": "Require 2 approvers for transactions over $10,000",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.filter(user, user.tags.contains('finance-team')).count() >= 2",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value > 10000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Automated payments to allowlisted recipients

```json
{
  "policyName": "Backend can execute scheduled payroll",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.id == '<BACKEND_API_USER_ID>')",
  "condition": "eth.tx.to in ['<EMPLOYEE_1>', '<EMPLOYEE_2>', '<EMPLOYEE_3>'] && eth.tx.value <= 10000000000000000000000"
}
```

## Implementation workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your organization">
    Sign up for Turnkey and create your parent organization. This serves as your administrative control plane.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create operational wallets">
    Create wallets for your business operations: treasury, payroll, vendor payments. See [Wallets Concept](/concepts/wallets) for HD wallet structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define user roles">
    Create user tags representing roles in your organization (finance, operations, executive). Add users and assign appropriate tags.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement policies">
    Write policies encoding your approval workflows and spending controls. See [Policy Quickstart](/concepts/policies/quickstart) for setup guidance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build payment workflows">
    Integrate Turnkey's API to build approval interfaces, payment automation, and operational dashboards. See [Transaction Automation](/signing-automation/overview) for backend signing patterns.
  </Step>
