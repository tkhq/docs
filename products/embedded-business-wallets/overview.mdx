## Embedded Business Wallets

Manage your organization's wallets with programmable controls. Define approval workflows, spending limits, and access policies. See [Embedded Wallets Overview](/embedded-wallets/overview) for the consumer-facing counterpart.

## Why Turnkey for Embedded Business Wallets?

The same [Embedded Wallet Kit](/embedded-wallets/overview) that powers consumer applications works equally well for internal business operations: treasury, payroll, vendor payments, and operational funds.

Let Turnkey run your wallet infrastructure for business operations. Define who can sign, what they can sign, and how many approvals are required. Set spending limits and recipient allowlists. Private key material and sensitive operations are protected through Turnkey's [verifiable security architecture](/security/our-approach).

Use the policy engine to define your approval workflows. No contract deployments or on-chain coordination necessary.

## Common use cases

| Need | Turnkey solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Merchant deposit addresses](#example-merchant-deposit-addresses-with-automated-sweeping) | Instant wallet provisioning with policy-enforced sweeping to omnibus |
| [Treasury management](#example-multi-approval-workflows) | Centralized funds with role-based access and multi-approval requirements |
| [Payroll automation](#example-scheduled-recurring-payments) | Scheduled payments to allowlisted recipients without manual signing |
| [Vendor payments](#example-contractor-and-vendor-payments) | Contact lists with pre-approved addresses and spending limits |
| [Delegated spending](#example-delegated-spending-authority) | Grant limited payment authority to teams or individuals |
| [Multi-approval workflows](#example-multi-approval-workflows) | Require 2+ approvers for high-value transactions |
| [Asset restrictions](#example-merchant-deposit-addresses-with-automated-sweeping) | Only approved tokens (e.g., USDC) can be transferred |

## Core capabilities

**Programmable approval requirements**: Define how many approvals each transaction type needs. Small payments auto-approve. Large transfers require multiple signers. Update thresholds without code changes.

**Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Tag users as "finance-team" or "executive", then use Turnkey's policy engine to grant specific permissions to those groups.

**Recipient allowlists**: Maintain approved vendor and contractor addresses. Payments to known recipients can bypass additional approval steps.

**Automated scheduled payments**: Backend services sign recurring transactions (payroll, subscriptions) based on policy rules. No manual intervention required.

**Spending limits**: Enforce per-transaction maximums, daily outflow caps, and asset restrictions at the policy level.

## Example: Merchant deposit addresses with automated sweeping

Provision deposit addresses instantly for merchants or customers. Enforce that funds can only move to your omnibus wallet, and only approved assets (like USDC) can be transferred.

**Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Merchant A     │     │  Merchant B     │     │  Merchant C     │
│  Deposit Addr   │     │  Deposit Addr   │     │  Deposit Addr   │
└────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         │    USDC-only policy   │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
                    ┌────────────────────────┐
                    │    Omnibus Wallet      │
                    │    (Consolidated)      │
                    └────────────────────────┘
```

**Policy: Restrict transfers to USDC only, omnibus destination only**

```json
{
  "policyName": "USDC transfers to omnibus only",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('sweep-service'))",
  "condition": "eth.tx.to == '<USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>' && eth.tx.data[34..74] == '<OMNIBUS_WALLET_ADDRESS>'"
}
```

All other transfer attempts are implicitly denied. Wrong token? Denied. Wrong destination? Denied. The policy engine enforces your rules at signing time.

**Transaction flow:**
1. Create merchant wallet instantly via API (under 2 seconds)
2. Customer deposits funds to merchant's address
3. Backend sweep service lists balances across all merchant wallets
4. Sweep service signs transfers to omnibus wallet
5. Policy enforces USDC-only, omnibus-only at signing time

## Example: Contractor and vendor payments

Maintain a contact list of approved payment recipients. Store each contractor's preferred wallet address for USDC disbursements.

**Set up recipient allowlist policy:**

```json
{
  "policyName": "Auto-approve payments to verified vendors",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('accounts-payable'))",
  "condition": "eth.tx.to in ['<VENDOR_1_ADDRESS>', '<VENDOR_2_ADDRESS>', '<CONTRACTOR_ADDRESS>']"
}
```

Payments to known recipients execute with single approval. Add new vendors by updating the policy. No on-chain changes required.

## Example: Scheduled recurring payments

Set up automated payments that execute on a schedule without manual signing. Pay contractors on the last business day of each month for the next 6 months.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure payment schedule">
    Define recurring payments in your application: recipient, amount, frequency, duration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create backend signing policy">
    Allow your backend service to sign transactions to specific recipients up to specified amounts:

    ```json
    {
      "policyName": "Backend can execute monthly contractor payments",
      "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
      "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.id == '<BACKEND_API_USER_ID>')",
      "condition": "eth.tx.to in ['<CONTRACTOR_1>', '<CONTRACTOR_2>'] && eth.tx.value <= 5000000000000000000000"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger payments on schedule">
    Your backend executes payments when due. No manual approval required for pre-authorized recipients and amounts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Delegated spending authority

Grant limited payment permissions to individuals or teams without giving full wallet access.

### Petty cash for operators

```json
{
  "policyName": "Operators can make small purchases",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('operator'))",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value <= 500000000000000000000"
}
```

### Contractor self-service withdrawals

```json
{
  "policyName": "Contractor can withdraw earned funds to registered address",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.id == '<CONTRACTOR_USER_ID>')",
  "condition": "eth.tx.to == '<CONTRACTOR_WALLET_ADDRESS>' && eth.tx.value <= 2000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Department budgets

Assign each department a spending limit. Marketing can spend up to $25k without executive approval:

```json
{
  "policyName": "Marketing team budget authority",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('marketing-team'))",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value <= 25000000000000000000000"
}
```

## Example: Multi-approval workflows

Require multiple approvers for high-value or sensitive transactions.

### Two finance approvers for large payments

```json
{
  "policyName": "Require 2 finance approvers for transactions over $10,000",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.filter(user, user.tags.contains('finance-team')).count() >= 2",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value > 10000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Executive approval for major transactions

```json
{
  "policyName": "CFO required for transactions over $50,000",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('cfo'))",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value > 50000000000000000000000"
}
```

## Example: Spending controls

Implement organizational controls beyond simple approval requirements.

| Control | Policy approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Per-transaction limits** | Set `eth.tx.value` ceiling in condition |
| **Recipient restrictions** | Allowlist addresses with `eth.tx.to in [...]` |
| **Role-based limits** | Different `consensus` rules per spending tier |
| **Asset restrictions** | Filter by contract address for token transfers |
