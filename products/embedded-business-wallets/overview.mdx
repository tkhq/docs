title: "Embedded Business Wallets"
description: "Use Turnkey's embedded wallet infrastructure for internal enterprise operations: treasury management, payroll automation, vendor payments, and organizational spending controls."

> Traditional enterprise wallet solutions force organizations to choose between security and usability. Multisig wallets provide security through multiple approvals but are operationally complex and slow. Centralized treasury tools offer convenience but create single points of failure. Turnkey's Embedded Business Wallets eliminate this tradeoff by combining programmable policy controls with a seamless operational experience.

## Why Embedded Business Wallets?

Embedded wallets are typically associated with consumer applications, where each end user gets their own wallet. But the same infrastructure that powers millions of consumer wallets is equally powerful for internal enterprise use cases:

- **Treasury management**: Centralize organizational funds with granular access controls
- **Payroll and contractor payments**: Automate recurring disbursements without manual signing
- **Vendor payments**: Maintain contact lists and streamline accounts payable workflows
- **Operational wallets**: Delegate specific payment authorities to teams or individuals

With Turnkey, you get the security benefits of multisig (multiple approvals, separation of duties) combined with the programmability and automation that traditional multisig solutions lack.

## Multisig Security, Without the Multisig Complexity

Traditional multisig wallets require coordinating multiple signers for every transaction. This creates operational friction:

- Signers must be available simultaneously
- Gas costs increase with signature count
- Adding or removing signers requires on-chain transactions
- No granular control over what transactions require approval

Turnkey's policy engine delivers equivalent security guarantees with superior flexibility:

## Key Capabilities

### Role-Based Access Control

Assign different permissions to different team members using user tags:

```json
{
  "policyName": "Finance team can sign transactions up to $5,000",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('finance-team'))",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value <= 5000000000000000000000"
}
```

| Role | Permissions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operator** | Sign transactions up to $1,000 to pre-approved addresses |
| **Finance** | Sign transactions up to $10,000, add recipients to allowlist |
| **Treasury** | Sign any transaction with single approval |
| **Executive** | Required for transactions over $50,000 |

### Multi-Approval Workflows

Require multiple approvers for high-value transactions, just like multisig, but with programmable thresholds:

```json
{
  "policyName": "Require 2 finance approvers for transactions over $10,000",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.filter(user, user.tags.contains('finance-team')).count() >= 2",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.value > 10000000000000000000000"
}
```

Unlike on-chain multisig:
- Add or remove approvers instantly (no on-chain transactions)
- Different approval requirements for different transaction types
- Approval collection happens off-chain (no coordination overhead)

### Delegated Permissions

Grant specific, limited permissions to individuals or teams without giving them full wallet access:

```json
{
  "policyName": "Contractor can withdraw up to $500/day to their registered address",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.id == '<CONTRACTOR_USER_ID>')",
  "condition": "activity.resource == 'PRIVATE_KEY' && activity.action == 'SIGN' && eth.tx.to == '<CONTRACTOR_ADDRESS>' && eth.tx.value <= 500000000000000000000"
}
```

Use cases:
- **Petty cash**: Operators can make small purchases without approval
- **Contractor advances**: Allow contractors to withdraw earned funds
- **Department budgets**: Each department controls their allocation

### Recipient Allowlists

Maintain a contact list of approved payment recipients. Payments to allowlisted addresses can be auto-approved or require fewer approvals:

```json
{
  "policyName": "Auto-approve payments to verified vendors",
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.tags.contains('finance-team'))",
  "condition": "eth.tx.to in ['<VENDOR_1_ADDRESS>', '<VENDOR_2_ADDRESS>', '<VENDOR_3_ADDRESS>']"
}
```

Common patterns:
- Vendor payment addresses (accounts payable)
- Contractor wallet addresses (payroll)
- Exchange deposit addresses (treasury operations)
- Internal wallet addresses (inter-account transfers)

### Automated Scheduled Payments

Set up recurring payments that execute automatically based on your policy rules:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define payment schedule">
    Configure recurring payments in your application: amount, recipient, frequency (weekly, monthly, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create permissive policy">
    Create a policy that allows your backend service to sign scheduled transactions:

    ```json
    {
      "policyName": "Backend can execute scheduled payroll",
      "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
      "consensus": "approvers.any(user, user.id == '<BACKEND_API_USER_ID>')",
      "condition": "eth.tx.to in ['<EMPLOYEE_1>', '<EMPLOYEE_2>', '<EMPLOYEE_3>'] && eth.tx.value <= 10000000000000000000000"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate execution">
    Your backend triggers payments on schedule. No manual signing required for pre-approved recipients and amounts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Example: Pay contractors on the last business day of each month for the next 6 months, without requiring manual approval for each payment.

### Spending Controls

Implement organizational spending limits and controls that would be impossible with traditional wallets:

| Control Type | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Per-transaction limits** | No single transaction over $50,000 |
| **Daily/weekly limits** | Maximum $100,000 in outflows per day |
| **Recipient restrictions** | Only send to verified addresses |
| **Time-based controls** | No transactions outside business hours |
| **Asset restrictions** | Only USDC transfers from this wallet |

## Real-World Implementation: Mural Pay

[Mural Pay](https://www.turnkey.com/customers/mural-pay-cross-border-payments) demonstrates how Turnkey's infrastructure powers enterprise-grade payment operations at scale.

### The Challenge

Mural Pay needed to simplify cryptocurrency payments for non-crypto-native organizations. Their platform initially required users to understand blockchain mechanics, limiting their addressable market.

### The Solution

By integrating Turnkey's wallet infrastructure, Mural Pay delivers a fintech-like payment experience:

- **Simplified authentication**: Non-custodial embedded wallets via passkey or email, eliminating seed phrase management
- **Secure infrastructure**: Turnkey's secure enclaves protect organizational funds
- **High-speed transactions**: 50-100ms transaction signing for seamless payment experiences

### The Results

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Monthly stablecoin payments | 5,000+ |
| Transaction volume (12 months) | $200M+ |
| Monthly infrastructure savings | $3,000 |
| Integration time | 3 weeks |
