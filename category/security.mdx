Turnkey is the first verifiable key management system of its kind, securing millions of wallets and private keys for a wide variety of use cases.
Turnkey's security architecture ensures that raw private keys are never exposed to Turnkey, your software, or your team.
We provide end-to-end private key generation and access control within secure enclaves, with strong isolation guarantees and
cryptographic attestation proving that only authorized code is running. Our custom-built operating system, QuorumOS,
minimizes attack surface and enables reproducible, auditable deployments. From hardware-backed trust to multi-factor access controls,
every layer of Turnkey's architecture is designed to be secure, verifiable, and developer-friendly by default. Our whitepaper covers our
holistic security model in-depth, and speaks to our vision for building verifiable key management infrastructure. Learn more about our approach to security here.
