## Address derivation

Turnkey supports Cosmos address derivation. The address formats we support follow the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/) standard for bech32 addresses.

## Transaction construction and signing

To construct and sign Cosmos transactions with Turnkey, we offer:

- [`@turnkey/cosmjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/cosmjs): exports a `TurnkeyDirectWallet` that serves as a drop-in replacement for a CosmJS direct wallet. It includes support for `signDirect`.

See it in action in our example:

- [`examples/with-cosmjs`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-cosmjs): demonstrates transaction construction and broadcast on Cosmos.

## Integration Example

Here's a minimal example showing how to initialize a Turnkey signer for Cosmos and perform basic operations:

```js [expandable]
import { Turnkey } from "@turnkey/sdk-server";
import { TurnkeyDirectWallet } from "@turnkey/cosmjs";
import { toHex } from "@cosmjs/encoding";
import { SigningStargateClient } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

// Initialize the Turnkey client
const turnkeyClient = new Turnkey({
  apiBaseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com",
  apiPrivateKey: process.env.API_PRIVATE_KEY,
  apiPublicKey: process.env.API_PUBLIC_KEY,
  defaultOrganizationId: process.env.ORGANIZATION_ID,
});

// Initialize a Turnkey signer for Cosmos
async function initializeCosmosWallet() {
  // Create a Turnkey-powered Cosmos wallet
  const wallet = await TurnkeyDirectWallet.init({
    config: {
      client: turnkeyClient.apiClient(),
      organizationId: process.env.ORGANIZATION_ID,
      signWith: process.env.COSMOS_ADDRESS, // Your Cosmos address in Turnkey
    },
    prefix: "cosmos", // Change to the appropriate chain prefix (e.g., "celestia", "osmo", etc.)
  });

  // Get the account details
  const account = (await wallet.getAccounts())[0];
  if (!account) throw new Error("No account found");

  console.log("Wallet address:", account.address);
  // Compressed public key
  console.log("Public key:", toHex(account.pubkey));

  return wallet;
}

// Connect to a chain and send a transaction
async function sendTransaction() {
  const wallet = await initializeCosmosWallet();

  // Connect to a Cosmos chain RPC endpoint
  const client = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(
    "https://rpc.cosmos.network", // Replace with your preferred RPC endpoint
    wallet
  );

  // Get account balance
  const balance = await client.getAllBalances(wallet.address);

  // Send tokens
  const recipient = "cosmos1..."; // Recipient address
  const amount = [{ denom: "uatom", amount: "1000" }]; // 0.001 ATOM

  const result = await client.sendTokens(
    wallet.address,
    recipient,
    amount,
    {
      amount: [{ denom: "uatom", amount: "5000" }], // Fee
      gas: "200000",
    },
    "Transaction memo"
  );
}
```

## Supported Cosmos Chains

Turnkey supports various Cosmos ecosystem chains for address derivation and signing, including but not limited to:

- Cosmos Hub (ATOM)
- Celestia
- Osmosis
- Injective
- Juno
- Stargaze
- Akash
- Secret Network

## Key Features

- **Drop-in Replacement**: `TurnkeyDirectWallet` works as a direct replacement for standard CosmJS signers
- **Chain Agnostic**: Works with any Cosmos SDK-based chain by changing the prefix
- **Secure Signing**: All private keys remain secure in Turnkey's infrastructure
- **Policy Control**: Apply custom signing policies to control transaction approvals

If you are using a Cosmos chain we do not explicitly support, feel free to contact us at [hello@turnkey.com](mailto:hello@turnkey.com), on [X](https://x.com/turnkeyhq/), or [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clubturnkey/shared_invite/zt-31v4yhgw6-PwBzyNsWCCBTk2xft3EoHQ).
