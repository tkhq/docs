## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you've completed the steps to create an account, organization, and API keypair as described in the [Account Setup](/getting-started/quickstart) section.

## Installation

Install the Turnkey CLI to get started:

```bash
brew install tkhq/tap/turnkey
```

We use Homebrew for a quick installation process. For a more secure installation that requires no trust in external parties, see our [CLI repository](https://github.com/tkhq/tkcli).

## Transaction Signing

<Steps>
<Step title="Setup">

Set the `ORGANIZATION_ID` environment variable to your organization ID. This will be used to identify your organization in the API requests.

```bash
export ORGANIZATION_ID=<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>
```

An API keypair is required to authenticate requests to the Turnkey API.

Create a new key named `quickstart` using the turnkey CLI:

```bash
turnkey generate api-key --organization $ORGANIZATION_ID --key-name quickstart
```

Create a new encryption key using the turnkey CLI:

```bash
turnkey generate encryption-key --organization $ORGANIZATION_ID --user $USER_ID
```

You'll see output like this:

```json
{
  "privateKeyFile": "/home/user/.config/turnkey/keys/quickstart.private",
  "publicKey": "03...72",
  "publicKeyFile": "/home/user/.config/turnkey/keys/quickstart.public"
}
```

Follow the instructions in this [guide](/sdks/cli#add-your-public-api-key) to add your new public API key to your organization via the dashboard.

</Step>
<Step title="Create Wallet">

Wallets are collections of cryptographic key pairs typically used for sending and receiving digital assets. To create one, we need to provide a name:

```bash
turnkey wallets create --name default --key-name quickstart
```

<Note>
  This command requires a key named `quickstart` to exist in your configuration. This key should have been created during the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide. It also requires you to create an encryption key named "default" which you'd find in the encryption-keys directory of your turnkey config. If you haven't created those yet, please complete the initial setup steps first.

If the key doesn't exist, you'll see an error like this:

```json
{
  "error": "failed to load key bytes \"quickstart\": failed to read from \"/.config/turnkey/keys/quickstart.private\": open /.config/turnkey/keys/quickstart.private: no such file or directory"
}
```

If the key exists but has not been added to your organization, you'll see an error like this:

```json
{
  "error": "failed to associate the API key with an organization; please manually specify the organization ID"
}
```

If the encryption key doesn't exist, you'll see an error like this:

```json
{
  "error": "failed to associate the API key with an organization; please manually specify the organization ID"
}
```

</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Create Ethereum Account">

To create a cryptographic key pair on our new wallet, we need to pass our desired address format:

```bash
turnkey wallets accounts create --wallet default --address-format ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM --key-name quickstart
```

This command will produce an Ethereum address (e.g. `0x08cb1216C95149DF66978b574E484869512CE2bF`) that we'll need to sign a transaction. You can see your new Wallet account with:

```bash
turnkey wallets accounts list --wallet default --key-name quickstart
```

</Step>
<Step title="Sign a Transaction">

Now you can sign an Ethereum transaction with this new address with our [`sign_transaction` endpoint](/api-reference/signing/sign-transaction). Make sure to replace the `unsignedTransaction` below with your own. You can use our [simple transaction generator](https://build.tx.xyz) if you need a quick transaction for testing:

```bash
turnkey request --path /public/v1/submit/sign_transaction --body '{
    "timestampMs": "'"$(date +%s)"'000",
    "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_SIGN_TRANSACTION_V2",
    "organizationId": "'"$ORGANIZATION_ID"'",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "TRANSACTION_TYPE_ETHEREUM",
      "signWith": "<Your Ethereum address>",
      "unsignedTransaction": "<Your Transaction>"
    }
}' --key-name quickstart
```

If you'd like to broadcast your transaction, you can easily do so
via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/pushTx).
