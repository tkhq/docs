**The pattern for migrating a wallet to Turnkey is straightforward**: we want to export the wallet from the existing provider, and securely import it to Turnkey.

No matter which approach, it is recommended to create a [sub-organization](/concepts/sub-organizations) for each user. Each suborg can have its own set of wallets, authenticators, and policies that govern access. These '[delegated access](/concepts/policies/delegated-access)' flows are key to enabling powerful and secure use, whose configuration is an important part of the migration to Turnkey. For further guidance don't hesitate to reach out to [hello@turnkey.com](mailto:hello@turnkey.com).

## Non-custodial wallets

Migrating a non-custodial (user-owned) wallet to Turnkey follows the general pattern. Within your application, we want to invoke the outgoing provider's user facing export method, and prompt the user to copy over the key or seed to Turnkey's importer iframe.

### Export from existing provider

This export typically takes the form of an export modal which displays the private key or seed phrase in plaintext to the user. The specifics depend on your provider, but popular choices like Privy have [React `exportWallet`](https://docs.privy.io/wallets/wallets/export#react) methods designed for the user to copy their key/seed to clipboard.

### Import to Turnkey

Setting up the import modal is easy. We maintain an embedded iframe element on `import.turnkey.com`, which ensures the mnemonics and keys travel securely directly to and from Turnkey's infrastructure (instead of through yours). This frame should appear after the user has copied (exported) their key/seed in the first step, and will guide them through importing it to Turnkey.

We've created a package designed to help you insert this iframe and interact with it: `@turnkey/iframe-stamper`\
This is covered completely in the [Import- Embedded iframe](/embedded-wallets/code-examples/import#embedded-iframe) docs section.

## Custodial wallets

If instead you manage your users' wallets, the export/import pattern will be similar, but typically take the shape of a back-end service you control.

### Export from existing provider

The specifics will depend on the provider, but popular choices like Privy have [Node](https://docs.privy.io/wallets/wallets/export#nodejs) and [API](https://docs.privy.io/wallets/wallets/export#rest-api) based wallet export options.

It is preferable for this migration script to not directly write/save these exported keys to the local filesystem, and instead directly pass them to the below import methods as keys are retrieved.

### Import to Turnkey

There are two options for importing wallets to Turnkey programmatically, [Node](/embedded-wallets/code-examples/import#nodejs) (`@turnkey/sdk-server`) and [Turnkey CLI ](/embedded-wallets/code-examples/import#cli)(`tkcli`).
