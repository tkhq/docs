description: "Turnkey infrastructure is flexible by default. We intentionally prioritize low-level primitives in our product to avoid creating blockers for developers building new kinds of applications on Turnkey."
---

That said, we have built out several example services and applications to help illustrate the types of functionality that Turnkey can enable.

## Code examples

## Demos built with Turnkey

### Demo embedded wallet ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-embedded-wallet))

A comprehensive demo showcasing how to build an embedded wallet using Turnkey. This demo uses the [`@turnkey/sdk-browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-browser), [`@turnkey/sdk-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-react) and [`@turnkey/sdk-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-server) packages and includes features such as:

- User authentication with passkeys, email auth, and OAuth
- Creating new wallets and wallet accounts
- Sending and receiving funds
- Importing/Exporting a wallet
- Adding a credential to the wallet

### Demo consumer wallet ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-consumer-wallet))

A minimal consumer wallet app powered by Turnkey. Behind the scenes, it uses [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/ethers) for signing and WalletConnect (v1) for accessing dapps.

#### How Infinex leverages Turnkey and Gelato

Infinex, a platform designed to unify the decentralized ecosystem and applications under a single UX layer, eliminates the complexities of navigating fragmented crypto protocols. By integrating **Turnkey** and **Gelato**, Infinex delivers a seamless, secure, and cost-efficient experience for decentralized finance users.

- **Secure Key Management with Turnkey**: Infinex ensures private keys are securely managed within Turnkey’s infrastructure, removing the need for traditional wallet pop-ups. This approach streamlines authentication through passkeys, offering a frictionless and secure user experience.
- **Gasless Transactions with Gelato**: Leveraging Gelato’s Relay (ERC-2771), Infinex enables fully **sponsored transactions**, allowing users to interact with decentralized applications without ever paying gas fees. This enhances accessibility and usability, ensuring that users can participate without holding or managing native blockchain tokens for fees.

The synergy between Turnkey and Gelato allows Infinex to offer an intuitive, cost-free user experience while maintaining the highest standards of security and scalability.
