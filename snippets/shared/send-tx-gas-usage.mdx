## Checking Gas Usage

You can configure gas limits for both sub-orgs and all orgs. We recommend checking sub-org gas usage against the limit on the client side so your application can handle edge cases when approaching or exceeding the gas limit.

You may also want to monitor your all org gas usage regularly to see if you are approaching your gas limit.

```ts
const resp = await httpClient?.getGasUsage({})
if (resp?.usageUsd! > resp?.windowLimitUsd!) { // you can also configure this to be a threshold
  console.error("Gas usage limit exceeded for sponsored transactions");
  return
}
```
