## Overview

By embedding Turnkey’s SDK and leveraging our Fiat Onramp you get:

- Seamless user flows: No need to redirect off-site, users stay within your UI.
- Multiple payment rails: Credit/debit cards, bank transfers (ACH, SEPA), and more.
- Provider flexibility: You can choose between onramp providers, MoonPay and Coinbase, or run parallel flows.
- Compliance & KYC: Identity verification flows are built in from providers.

## Access and Pricing

Fiat Onramp is available to all Enterprise customers. To enable this feature, please reach out to the Turnkey team ([help@turnkey.com](mailto:help@turnkey.com)).

## Prerequisites

1. Choose the Onramp provider(s) you want to integrate with. See our current list of supported [Onramp Providers](#onramp-providers) below for coverage and pricing to best fit your needs.
1. Create an account with your chosen Onramp provider(s) and complete the required KYB process.
   - The typical KYB approval timeline will vary by Onramp provider. You can expect review to take 1-4 business days (or longer) depending on document availability and follow-up questions from the Onramp provider’s compliance team.
   - The requirements of the KYB process and the speed of review will vary by Onramp provider. Specific questions should be addressed to the Onramp provider directly.
   - The following is not an exhaustive list (and Onramp providers may ask for additional documentation), however the following documents may be requested as part of KYB compliance, depending on the Onramp provider you choose:
     - Corporate formation and governance documents (e.g. certificate of incorporation / articles of association; bylaws / operating agreement)
     - Proof of registration and status (e.g. business registration extract; certificate of good standing)
     - Ownership and control structure (e.g. register of shareholders / members; register of directors and officers; ultimate beneficial owner declaration)
     - Identification of directors, beneficial owners (often >10%), and sometimes senior management, including government-issued photo identification, proof of address (e.g. utility bill, bank statement, government letter < 3 months old). Beneficial owners that are entities may need to provide similar documents, as well.
1. Once your KYB application has been approved, you will be provisioned API Keys. You can then securely send your provisioned API Keys to Turnkey's Product Success team via pgp, secure email, or another secure channel. Turnkey will securely encrypt your API Keys.
1. You're now ready to start using Turnkey's Fiat Onramp.
