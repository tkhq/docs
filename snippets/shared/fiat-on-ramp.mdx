## Overview

By embedding Turnkey’s SDK and leveraging our Fiat Onramp you get:

- Seamless user flows: No need to redirect off-site, users stay within your UI.
- Multiple payment rails: Credit/debit cards, bank transfers (ACH, SEPA), and more.
- Provider flexibility: You can choose between onramp providers, MoonPay and Coinbase, or run parallel flows.
- Compliance & KYC: Identity verification flows are built in from providers.

## Access and Pricing

Fiat Onramp is available to all Enterprise customers. To enable this feature, please reach out to the Turnkey team ([help@turnkey.com](mailto:help@turnkey.com)).

2. Create an account with your chosen Onramp provider(s) and complete the required KYB process.
3. Once your KYB application has been approved, you will be provisioned API Keys. You can then securely send your provisioned API Keys to Turnkey's Product Success team via pgp, secure email, or another secure channel. Turnkey will securely encrypt your API Keys.
